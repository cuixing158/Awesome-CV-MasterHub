| **[MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08083v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, MambaVision, specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Through a comprehensive ablation study, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably sized backbones while demonstrating favorable performance.

| **[LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19777v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets.

| **[OpenLex3D: A New Evaluation Benchmark for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19764v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding has been transformed by open-vocabulary language models that enable interaction via natural language. However, the evaluation of these representations is limited to closed-set semantics that do not capture the richness of language. This work presents OpenLex3D, a dedicated benchmark to evaluate 3D open-vocabulary scene representations. OpenLex3D provides entirely new label annotations for 23 scenes from Replica, ScanNet++, and HM3D, which capture real-world linguistic variability by introducing synonymical object categories and additional nuanced descriptions. By introducing an open-set 3D semantic segmentation task and an object retrieval task, we provide insights on feature precision, segmentation, and downstream capabilities. We evaluate various existing 3D open-vocabulary methods on OpenLex3D, showcasing failure cases, and avenues for improvement. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://openlex3d.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://openlex3d.github.io/) |
| **[Show or Tell? Effectively prompting Vision-Language Models for semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19647v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being regarded as foundation models that can be instructed to solve diverse tasks by prompting, without task-specific training. We examine the seemingly obvious question: how to effectively prompt VLMs for semantic segmentation. To that end, we systematically evaluate the segmentation performance of several recent models guided by either text or visual prompts on the out-of-distribution MESS dataset collection. We introduce a scalable prompting scheme, few-shot prompted semantic segmentation, inspired by open-vocabulary segmentation and few-shot learning. It turns out that VLMs lag far behind specialist models trained for a specific segmentation task, by about 30% on average on the Intersection-over-Union metric. Moreover, we find that text prompts and visual prompts are complementary: each one of the two modes fails on many examples that the other one can solve. Our analysis suggests that being able to anticipate the most effective prompt modality can lead to a 11% improvement in performance. Motivated by our findings, we propose PromptMatcher, a remarkably simple training-free baseline that combines both text and visual prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results outperforming the best text-prompted VLM by 2.5%, and the top visual-prompted VLM by 3.5% on few-shot prompted semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RobustEMD: Domain Robust Matching for Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01110v4)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) aims to perform the limited annotated data learning in the medical image analysis scope. Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More details should be included, and more experiments</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19386v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accuracy Improvement of Cell Image Segmentation Using Feedback Former](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12974v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of microscopy cell images by deep learning is a significant technique. We considered that the Transformers, which have recently outperformed CNNs in image recognition, could also be improved and developed for cell image segmentation. Transformers tend to focus more on contextual information than on detailed information. This tendency leads to a lack of detailed information for segmentation. Therefore, to supplement or reinforce the missing detailed information, we hypothesized that feedback processing in the human visual cortex should be effective. Our proposed Feedback Former is a novel architecture for semantic segmentation, in which Transformers is used as an encoder and has a feedback processing mechanism. Feature maps with detailed information are fed back to the lower layers from near the output of the model to compensate for the lack of detailed information which is the weakness of Transformers and improve the segmentation accuracy. By experiments on three cell image datasets, we confirmed that our method surpasses methods without feedback, demonstrating its superior accuracy in cell image segmentation. Our method achieved higher segmentation accuracy while consuming less computational cost than conventional feedback approaches. Moreover, our method offered superior precision without simply increasing the model size of Transformer encoder, demonstrating higher accuracy with lower computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024 Workshop "Human-inspired Computer Vision (HCV)". 2025/3/19 : This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

| **[Hard-aware Instance Adaptive Self-training for Unsupervised Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06992v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The divergence between labeled training data and unlabeled testing data is a significant challenge for recent deep learning models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to solve such problem. Recent works show that self-training is a powerful approach to UDA. However, existing methods have difficulty in balancing the scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose a hard-aware instance adaptive self-training framework for UDA on the task of semantic segmentation. To effectively improve the quality and diversity of pseudo-labels, we develop a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with an instance adaptive selector. We further enrich the hard class pseudo-labels with inter-image information through a skillfully designed hard-aware pseudo-label augmentation. Besides, we propose the region-adaptive regularization to smooth the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. For the non-pseudo-label region, consistency constraint is also constructed to introduce stronger supervision signals during model optimization. Our method is so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other UDA methods. Experiments on GTA5 to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, and Cityscapes to Oxford RobotCar demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[BIMII-Net: Brain-Inspired Multi-Iterative Interactive Network for RGB-T Road Scene Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19303v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-T road scene semantic segmentation enhances visual scene understanding in complex environments characterized by inadequate illumination or occlusion by fusing information from RGB and thermal images. Nevertheless, existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models typically depend on simple addition or concatenation strategies or ignore the differences between information at different levels. To address these issues, we proposed a novel RGB-T road scene semantic segmentation network called Brain-Inspired Multi-Iteration Interaction Network (BIMII-Net). First, to meet the requirements of accurate texture and local information extraction in road scenarios like autonomous driving, we proposed a deep continuous-coupled neural network (DCCNN) architecture based on a brain-inspired model. Second, to enhance the interaction and expression capabilities among multi-modal information, we designed a cross explicit attention-enhanced fusion module (CEAEF-Module) in the feature fusion stage of BIMII-Net to effectively integrate features at different levels. Finally, we constructed a complementary interactive multi-layer decoder structure, incorporating the shallow-level feature iteration module (SFI-Module), the deep-level feature iteration module (DFI-Module), and the multi-feature enhancement module (MFE-Module) to collaboratively extract texture details and global skeleton information, with multi-module joint supervision further optimizing the segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that BIMII-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the brain-inspired computing domain and outperforms most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods. It also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on multiple RGB-T datasets, proving the effectiveness of brain-inspired computer models in multi-modal image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation: Enhancing Pixel-Level Understanding with Large Language Models for Advanced Vision Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19276v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation has made significant strides in pixel-level image understanding, yet it remains limited in capturing contextual and semantic relationships between objects. Current models, such as CNN and Transformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but fail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., "doctor" vs. "nurse" in a hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g., differentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous driving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are employed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies that are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual understanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language, paving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DINO in the Room: Leveraging 2D Foundation Models for 3D Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18944v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on large-scale image datasets provide high-quality features that have significantly advanced 2D visual recognition. However, their potential in 3D vision remains largely untapped, despite the common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge this trend by introducing DITR, a simple yet effective approach that extracts 2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we further propose to distill 2D foundation models into a 3D backbone as a pretraining task. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from 2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks, ultimately boosting performance across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/DITR</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploring the Integration of Key-Value Attention Into Pure and Hybrid Transformers for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18862v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Preprint.

| **[No Thing, Nothing: Highlighting Safety-Critical Classes for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15910v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing domain generalization methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation under adverse weather struggle to accurately predict "things" categories compared to "stuff" categories. In typical driving scenes, "things" categories can be dynamic and associated with higher collision risks, making them crucial for safe navigation and planning. Recognizing the importance of "things" categories, we identify their performance drop as a serious bottleneck in existing approaches. We observed that adverse weather induces degradation of semantic-level features and both corruption of local features, leading to a misprediction of "things" as "stuff". To mitigate these corruptions, we suggest our method, NTN - segmeNt Things for No-accident. To address semantic-level feature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing the misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories. Additionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse weather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a regularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart in feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU gain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the SemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark. Notably, NTN achieves a +4.8 and +7.9 mIoU improvement on "things" classes, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Task-driven Image Fusion with Learnable Fusion Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03240v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion aggregates information from multiple sensor sources, achieving superior visual quality and perceptual features compared to single-source images, often improving downstream tasks. However, current fusion methods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that potentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and reducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image Fusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss guided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable parameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This module is supervised by the downstream task loss in a meta-learning manner. The learning objective is to minimize the task loss of fused images after optimizing the fusion module with the fusion loss. Iterative updates between the fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves toward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task objectives. TDFusion's training relies entirely on the downstream task loss, making it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture of fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance through fusion experiments conducted on four different datasets, in addition to evaluations on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HiRes-FusedMIM: A High-Resolution RGB-DSM Pre-trained Model for Building-Level Remote Sensing Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18540v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning have led to the development of foundation models that have significantly advanced performance in various computer vision tasks. However, despite their potential, these models often overlook the crucial role of high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) in understanding urban environments, particularly for building-level analysis, which is essential for applications like digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce HiRes-FusedMIM, a novel pre-trained model specifically designed to leverage the rich information contained within high-resolution RGB and DSM data. HiRes-FusedMIM utilizes a dual-encoder simple masked image modeling (SimMIM) architecture with a multi-objective loss function that combines reconstruction and contrastive objectives, enabling it to learn powerful, joint representations from both modalities. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of HiRes-FusedMIM on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Our results demonstrate that: 1) HiRes-FusedMIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial methods on several building-related datasets, including WHU Aerial and LoveDA, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and leveraging fine-grained building information; 2) Incorporating DSMs during pre-training consistently improves performance compared to using RGB data alone, highlighting the value of elevation information for building-level analysis; 3) The dual-encoder architecture of HiRes-FusedMIM, with separate encoders for RGB and DSM data, significantly outperforms a single-encoder model on the Vaihingen segmentation task, indicating the benefits of learning specialized representations for each modality. To facilitate further research and applications in this direction, we will publicly release the trained model weights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation under Sensor Failures: Missing and Noisy Modality Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18445v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field.

| **[PDDM: Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model for RGB-PD Semantic Segmentation Based in Complex Indoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18393v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of RGB and depth modalities significantly enhances the accuracy of segmenting complex indoor scenes, with depth data from RGB-D cameras playing a crucial role in this improvement. However, collecting an RGB-D dataset is more expensive than an RGB dataset due to the need for specialized depth sensors. Aligning depth and RGB images also poses challenges due to sensor positioning and issues like missing data and noise. In contrast, Pseudo Depth (PD) from high-precision depth estimation algorithms can eliminate the dependence on RGB-D sensors and alignment processes, as well as provide effective depth information and show significant potential in semantic segmentation. Therefore, to explore the practicality of utilizing pseudo depth instead of real depth for semantic segmentation, we design an RGB-PD segmentation pipeline to integrate RGB and pseudo depth and propose a Pseudo Depth Aggregation Module (PDAM) for fully exploiting the informative clues provided by the diverse pseudo depth maps. The PDAM aggregates multiple pseudo depth maps into a single modality, making it easily adaptable to other RGB-D segmentation methods. In addition, the pre-trained diffusion model serves as a strong feature extractor for RGB segmentation tasks, but multi-modal diffusion-based segmentation methods remain unexplored. Therefore, we present a Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model (PDDM) that adopts a large-scale text-image diffusion model as a feature extractor and a simple yet effective fusion strategy to integrate pseudo depth. To verify the applicability of pseudo depth and our PDDM, we perform extensive experiments on the NYUv2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that pseudo depth can effectively enhance segmentation performance, and our PDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by +6.98 mIoU on NYUv2 and +2.11 mIoU on SUNRGB-D.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the large number of parameters in these models, deploying them in real-time scenarios is a critical challenge, specifically in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. Knowledge distillation has emerged as a successful technique for addressing this problem by transferring knowledge from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a lighter model (student). In contrast to existing complex methodologies commonly employed for distilling knowledge from a teacher to a student, this paper showcases the efficacy of a simple yet powerful method for utilizing refined feature maps to transfer attention. The proposed method has proven to be effective in distilling rich information, outperforming existing methods in semantic segmentation as a dense prediction task. The proposed Attention-guided Feature Distillation (AttnFD) method, employs the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which refines feature maps by taking into account both channel-specific and spatial information content. Simply using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function between the refined feature maps of the teacher and the student, AttnFD demonstrates outstanding performance in semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of improving the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of the student network on the PascalVoc 2012, Cityscapes, COCO, and CamVid datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, and 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[MaSS13K: A Matting-level Semantic Segmentation Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18364v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as image editing, bokeh imaging, AR/VR, etc. Unfortunately, existing datasets often have limited resolution and lack precise mask details and boundaries. In this work, we build a large-scale, matting-level semantic segmentation dataset, named MaSS13K, which consists of 13,348 real-world images, all at 4K resolution. MaSS13K provides high-quality mask annotations of a number of objects, which are categorized into seven categories: human, vegetation, ground, sky, water, building, and others. MaSS13K features precise masks, with an average mask complexity 20-50 times higher than existing semantic segmentation datasets. We consequently present a method specifically designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation, namely MaSSFormer, which employs an efficient pixel decoder that aggregates high-level semantic features and low-level texture features across three stages, aiming to produce high-resolution masks with minimal computational cost. Finally, we propose a new learning paradigm, which integrates the high-quality masks of the seven given categories with pseudo labels from new classes, enabling MaSSFormer to transfer its accurate segmentation capability to other classes of objects. Our proposed MaSSFormer is comprehensively evaluated on the MaSS13K benchmark together with 14 representative segmentation models. We expect that our meticulously annotated MaSS13K dataset and the MaSSFormer model can facilitate the research of high-resolution and high-quality semantic segmentation.

Such information may be by obtained by estimating depth and semantic segmentation maps of the surrounding environment and for their practical use in autonomous navigation, the procedure must be performed as close to real-time as possible. In this paper, we leverage monocular cameras on aerial robots to predict depth and semantic maps in low-altitude unstructured environments. We propose a joint deep-learning architecture that can perform the two tasks accurately and rapidly, and validate its effectiveness on MidAir and Aeroscapes benchmark datasets. Our joint-architecture proves to be competitive or superior to the other single and joint architecture methods while performing its task fast predicting 20.2 FPS on a single NVIDIA quadro p5000 GPU and it has a low memory footprint.

Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMs' full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose \textbf{FisherTune}, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. FisherTune incorporates variational inference to stabilize DR-FIM estimation, treating parameters as Gaussian-distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that FisherTune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Constraint Consistency Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17914v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency regularization has prevailed in semi-supervised semantic segmentation and achieved promising performance. However, existing methods typically concentrate on enhancing the Image-augmentation based Prediction consistency and optimizing the segmentation network as a whole, resulting in insufficient utilization of potential supervisory information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Constraint Consistency Learning (MCCL) approach to facilitate the staged enhancement of the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we first design a feature knowledge alignment (FKA) strategy to promote the feature consistency learning of the encoder from image-augmentation. Our FKA encourages the encoder to derive consistent features for strongly and weakly augmented views from the perspectives of point-to-point alignment and prototype-based intra-class compactness. Moreover, we propose a self-adaptive intervention (SAI) module to increase the discrepancy of aligned intermediate feature representations, promoting Feature-perturbation based Prediction consistency learning.

| **[Efficient Self-supervised Vision Pretraining with Local Masked Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00790v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning for computer vision has achieved tremendous progress and improved many downstream vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Among these, generative self-supervised vision learning approaches such as MAE and BEiT show promising performance. However, their global masked reconstruction mechanism is computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose local masked reconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked reconstruction within a small window of 7$\times$7 patches on a simple Transformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy compared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained LoMaR on 384$\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing MAE by 0.6%. On MS COCO, LoMaR outperforms MAE by 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{box}$ on object detection and 0.5 $\text{AP}^\text{mask}$ on instance segmentation. LoMaR is especially more computation-efficient on pretraining high-resolution images, e.g., it is 3.1$\times$ faster than MAE with 0.2% higher classification accuracy on pretraining 448$\times$448 images. This local masked reconstruction learning mechanism can be easily integrated into any other generative self-supervised learning approach.

However, their complexity makes latent token representations difficult to interpret. We introduce ULTra, a framework for interpreting Transformer embeddings and uncovering meaningful semantic patterns within them. ULTra enables unsupervised semantic segmentation using pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a self-supervised training approach that refines segmentation performance by learning an external transformation matrix without modifying the underlying model. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised semantic segmentation, outperforming existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, we validate ULTra for model interpretation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, including Object Selection and interpretable text summarization using LLMs, demonstrating its broad applicability in explaining the semantic structure of latent token representations.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to their significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current semi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or consider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames, often overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous driving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such as roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects exhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is also captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby objects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these characteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and low-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These representations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the representations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively utilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiLoTs outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, and achieves performance close to LiDAR+Camera multimodal approaches.

| **[Multi-modality Anomaly Segmentation on the Road](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17712v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation allows autonomous driving cars to understand the surroundings of the vehicle comprehensively. However, it is also crucial for the model to detect obstacles that may jeopardize the safety of autonomous driving systems. Based on our experiments, we find that current uni-modal anomaly segmentation frameworks tend to produce high anomaly scores for non-anomalous regions in images. Motivated by this empirical finding, we develop a multi-modal uncertainty-based anomaly segmentation framework, named MMRAS+, for autonomous driving systems. MMRAS+ effectively reduces the high anomaly outputs of non-anomalous classes by introducing text-modal using the CLIP text encoder. Indeed, MMRAS+ is the first multi-modal anomaly segmentation solution for autonomous driving. Moreover, we develop an ensemble module to further boost the anomaly segmentation performance. Experiments on RoadAnomaly, SMIYC, and Fishyscapes validation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Even though Collaborative Perception (CP) improves AV perception in difficult conditions, existing CP datasets lack adverse weather conditions. To address this, we introduce Adver-City, the first open-source synthetic CP dataset focused on adverse weather conditions. Simulated in CARLA with OpenCDA, it contains over 24 thousand frames, over 890 thousand annotations, and 110 unique scenarios across six different weather conditions: clear weather, soft rain, heavy rain, fog, foggy heavy rain and, for the first time in a synthetic CP dataset, glare. It has six object categories including pedestrians and cyclists, and uses data from vehicles and roadside units featuring LiDARs, RGB and semantic segmentation cameras, GNSS, and IMUs. Its scenarios, based on real crash reports, depict the most relevant road configurations for adverse weather and poor visibility conditions, varying in object density, with both dense and sparse scenes, allowing for novel testing conditions of CP models. Benchmarks run on the dataset show that weather conditions created challenging conditions for perception models, with CoBEVT scoring 58.30/52.44/38.90 (AP@30/50/70).

This conventional approach, however, overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon: a framework-agnostic adaptation to convert an encoder-only self-supervised learning (SSL) contrastive approach to an efficient encoder-decoder framework that can be pre-trained in a contrastive manner. We first update the existing architecture to accommodate a decoder and its respective contrastive loss. We then introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives that facilitates the joint encoder-decoder architecture pre-training. We adapt two established contrastive SSL frameworks tailored for dense prediction tasks, achieve new state-of-the-art results in COCO object detection and instance segmentation, and match state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. We show that our approach allows for pre-training a decoder and enhances the representation power of the encoder and its performance in dense prediction tasks. This benefit holds across heterogeneous decoder architectures between pre-training and fine-tuning and persists in out-of-domain, limited-data scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FALCON: Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to Continual Semantic Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15965v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning in semantic scene segmentation aims to continually learn new unseen classes in dynamic environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning. However, fairness, another major challenge that causes unfair predictions leading to low performance among major and minor classes, still needs to be well addressed. In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This work presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes. Through our experiments, our proposed approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SoTA) performance on different continual learning benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC. It promotes the fairness of the continual semantic segmentation model.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR'25 | None |

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless, existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components, we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights, we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Minor Components Adaptation (SoMA), an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoMA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Moreover, we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy, thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoMA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection. In addition, our methods introduce no additional inference overhead or regularization loss, maintain compatibility with any backbone or head, and are designed to be versatile, allowing easy integration into a wide range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Project page: https://ysj9909.github.io/SoRA.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ysj9909.github.io/SoRA.github.io) |
| **[Center-guided Classifier for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16963v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared with natural images, remote sensing images (RSIs) have the unique characteristic. i.e., larger intraclass variance, which makes semantic segmentation for remote sensing images more challenging. Moreover, existing semantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla softmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for the pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of parametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque process of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which solves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision under Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each class, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding pixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes through hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we introduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of pixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms. Especially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide interpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the training set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior performance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight, compatibility, and interpretability.

Training high-quality deep-learning models for layer segmentation relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated data. However, due to the patient's privacy of medical data and scarce clinical cases, constructing pathological datasets from clinical sources is relatively difficult and expensive. Moreover, using external natural image datasets introduces noise during the domain generalization process. Cross-species homologous data, such as mouse kidney data, which exhibits high structural and feature similarity to human kidneys, has the potential to enhance model performance on human datasets. In this study, we incorporated the collected private Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stained mouse kidney dataset into the human kidney dataset for joint training. The results showed that after introducing cross-species homologous data, the semantic segmentation models based on CNN and Transformer architectures achieved an average increase of 1.77% and 1.24% in mIoU, and 1.76% and 0.89% in Dice score for the human renal cortex and medulla datasets, respectively. This approach is also capable of enhancing the model's generalization ability. This indicates that cross-species homologous data, as a low-noise trainable data source, can help improve model performance under conditions of limited clinical samples.

Traditional detection and segmentation methods supervise their models through bounding box labels and semantic mask labels. However, these two independent labels inherently contain significant redundancy. This paper aims to eliminate the redundancy by supervising 3D object detection using only semantic labels. However, the challenge arises due to the incomplete geometry structure and boundary ambiguity of point-cloud instances, leading to inaccurate pseudo labels and poor detection results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named Seg2Box. We first introduce a Multi-Frame Multi-Scale Clustering (MFMS-C) module, which leverages the spatio-temporal consistency of point clouds to generate accurate box-level pseudo-labels. Additionally, the Semantic?Guiding Iterative-Mining Self-Training (SGIM-ST) module is proposed to enhance the performance by progressively refining the pseudo-labels and mining the instances without generating pseudo-labels. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset show that our method significantly outperforms other competitive methods by 23.7\% and 10.3\% in mAP, respectively. The results demonstrate the great label-efficient potential and advancement of our method.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Recently, the large vision model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), has shown strong zero-shot segmentation performance on both images and videos. When extending SAM2 to MMSS, two issues arise: 1. How can SAM2 be adapted to multi-modal data? 2. How can SAM2 better understand semantics? Inspired by cross-frame correlation in videos, we propose to treat multi-modal data as a sequence of frames representing the same scene. Our key idea is to ''memorize'' the modality-agnostic information and 'memorize' the semantics related to the targeted scene. To achieve this, we apply SAM2's memory mechanisms across multi-modal data to capture modality-agnostic features. Meanwhile, to memorize the semantic knowledge, we propose a training-only Semantic Prototype Memory Module (SPMM) to store category-level prototypes across training for facilitating SAM2's transition from instance to semantic segmentation. A prototypical adaptation loss is imposed between global and local prototypes iteratively to align and refine SAM2's semantic understanding. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MemorySAM outperforms SoTA methods by large margins on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks (65.38% on DELIVER, 52.88% on MCubeS).

Although some datasets encompass variations in weather and lighting, bad weather scenarios do not appear often.

However, the efficacy under a large domain gap between pre-training (e.g. RGB) and fine-tuning (e.g. infrared) remains underexplored. In this study, we first benchmark the infrared semantic segmentation performance of various pre-training methods and reveal several phenomena distinct from the RGB domain. Next, our layerwise analysis of pre-trained attention maps uncovers that: (1) There are three typical attention patterns (local, hybrid, and global); (2) Pre-training tasks notably influence the pattern distribution across layers; (3) The hybrid pattern is crucial for semantic segmentation as it attends to both nearby and foreground elements; (4) The texture bias impedes model generalization in infrared tasks. Building on these insights, we propose UNIP, a UNified Infrared Pre-training framework, to enhance the pre-trained model performance. This framework uses the hybrid-attention distillation NMI-HAD as the pre-training target, a large-scale mixed dataset InfMix for pre-training, and a last-layer feature pyramid network LL-FPN for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that UNIP outperforms various pre-training methods by up to 13.5\% in average mIoU on three infrared segmentation tasks, evaluated using fine-tuning and linear probing metrics. UNIP-S achieves performance on par with MAE-L while requiring only 1/10 of the computational cost.

This allows users to selectively apply text-driven style changes to specific segments (e.g., ``turn the building into a cyberpunk tower'') while leaving other regions (e.g., ``people'' or ``trees'') unchanged. By incorporating region-wise condition vectors and a region-specific directional loss, our method achieves high-fidelity transformations that respect both semantic boundaries and user-driven style descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can flexibly handle complex scene stylizations in real-world scenarios, improving control and quality over purely global style transfer methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Further, since the DNN behavior cannot be assessed through code inspection and analysis, test automation has become an essential activity to gain confidence in the reliability of DNNs. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art automated testing solutions largely rely on simulators, whose fidelity is always imperfect, thus affecting the validity of test results. To address such limitations, we propose to combine meta-heuristic search, used to explore the input space using simulators, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform the data generated by simulators into realistic input images. Such images can be used both to assess the DNN performance and to retrain the DNN more effectively. We applied our approach to a state-of-the-art DNN performing semantic segmentation and demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art GAN-based testing solution and several baselines. Specifically, it leads to the largest number of diverse images leading to the worst DNN performance. Further, the images generated with our approach, lead to the highest improvement in DNN performance when used for retraining. In conclusion, we suggest to always integrate GAN components when performing search-driven, simulator-based testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency.

It emphasizes the transition from convolutional architectures to transformer-based pre-trained models, underscoring their potential in global geospatial analysis. A workflow is presented for automatically generating geospatial datasets, enabling the creation of semantic segmentation datasets from various sources, including WMS/WMTS links, vectorial cartography, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) overpass-turbo requests. The developed code allows a fast dataset generation process for training machine learning models using openly available data without manual labelling. Using aerial imagery and vectorial data from the respective geographical offices of Madrid and Vienna, two datasets were generated for car and pedestrian surface detection. A transformer-based model was trained and evaluated for each city, demonstrating good accuracy values. The historical trend analysis involved applying the trained model to earlier images predating the availability of vectorial data 10 to 20 years, successfully identifying temporal trends in infrastructure for pedestrians and cars across different city areas. This technique is applicable for municipal governments to gather valuable data at a minimal cost.</p></details> | Preprint | None |
| **[CAM-Seg: A Continuous-valued Embedding Approach for Semantic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15617v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional transformer-based semantic segmentation relies on quantized embeddings. However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on segmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than continuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a continuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By reformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding diffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent representations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our key contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that learns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range dependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture combining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided transformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for semantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain adaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space. Experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted variants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts, including adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model also exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\approx$ 95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and moderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate impact ($\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise, saturation and hue shifts.

| **[Semantic Segmentation of Transparent and Opaque Drinking Glasses with the Help of Zero-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15004v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmenting transparent structures in images is challenging since they are difficult to distinguish from the background. Common examples are drinking glasses, which are a ubiquitous part of our lives and appear in many different shapes and sizes. In this work we propose TransCaGNet, a modified version of the zero-shot model CaGNet. We exchange the segmentation backbone with the architecture of Trans4Trans to be capable of segmenting transparent objects. Since some glasses are rarely captured, we use zeroshot learning to be able to create semantic segmentations of glass categories not given during training. We propose a novel synthetic dataset covering a diverse set of different environmental conditions. Additionally we capture a real-world evaluation dataset since most applications take place in the real world. Comparing our model with Zeg-Clip we are able to show that TransCaGNet produces better mean IoU and accuracy values while ZegClip outperforms it mostly for unseen classes. To improve the segmentation results, we combine the semantic segmentation of the models with the segmentation results of SAM 2. Our evaluation emphasizes that distinguishing between different classes is challenging for the models due to similarity, points of view, or coverings. Taking this behavior into account, we assign glasses multiple possible categories. The modification leads to an improvement up to 13.68% for the mean IoU and up to 17.88% for the mean accuracy values on the synthetic dataset. Using our difficult synthetic dataset for training, the models produce even better results on the real-world dataset. The mean IoU is improved up to 5.55% and the mean accuracy up to 5.72% on the real-world dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In this context, we introduce the Unified Segmentation Attention Mechanism Network (USAM-Net), a novel convolutional neural network that integrates stereo image inputs with semantic segmentation maps and attention to enhance depth estimation performance. USAM-Net employs a dual-pathway architecture, which combines a pre-trained segmentation model (SAM) and a depth estimation model. The segmentation pathway preprocesses the stereo images to generate semantic masks, which are then concatenated with the stereo images as inputs to the depth estimation pathway. This integration allows the model to focus on important features such as object boundaries and surface textures which are crucial for accurate depth perception. Empirical evaluation on the DrivingStereo dataset demonstrates that USAM-Net achieves superior performance metrics, including a Global Difference (GD) of 3.61\% and an End-Point Error (EPE) of 0.88, outperforming traditional models such as CFNet, SegStereo, and iResNet. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating segmentation information into stereo depth estimation tasks, highlighting the potential of USAM-Net in applications demanding high-precision depth data.</p></details> |  | None |

The first stage does not use backpropagation. Rather, it exploits the Hebbian principle ``fire together, wire together'' as a local learning rule for updating the weights of both convolutional and transpose-convolutional layers, allowing unsupervised discovery of data features. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with standard backpropagation on a small subset of labeled data. We evaluate our methodology through experiments conducted on several widely used biomedical datasets, deeming that this domain is paramount in computer vision and is notably impacted by data scarcity. Results show that our proposed method outperforms SOTA approaches across different levels of label availability. Furthermore, we show that using our unsupervised stage to initialize the SOTA approaches leads to performance improvements.

The first methods were based on pixel-wise skin color modeling and they were later enhanced with context-based analysis to include the textural and geometrical features, recently extracted using deep convolutional neural networks. It has been also demonstrated that skin regions can be segmented from grayscale images without using color information at all. However, the possibility to combine these two sources of information has not been explored so far and we address this research gap with the contribution reported in this paper. We propose to train a convolutional network using the datasets focused on different features to create an ensemble whose individual outcomes are effectively combined using yet another convolutional network trained to produce the final segmentation map. The experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the basic classifiers, as well as an ensemble based on the voting scheme. We expect that this study will help in developing new ensemble-based techniques that will improve the performance of semantic segmentation systems, reaching beyond the problem of detecting human skin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for IBERAMIA 2024</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven to be advantageous in incorporating unclassified information from the target domain. However, independently fine-tuning UDA models on the source and target domains has a limited effect on the outcome. This paper proposes a hybrid training strategy as well as a novel dual-domain image fusion strategy that effectively utilizes the original image, transformation image, and intermediate domain information.

Driven by the motivation that streamlining the infrared flow and harnessing PVMs with fewer parameters for superior performance, we propose "IV-tuning", a novel and general fine-tuning approach, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various infrared-visible downstream tasks. At its core, IV-tuning freezes pre-trained visible-based PVMs and integrates infrared flow into modal prompts to interact with adapters, which achieves a more efficient and general modal interaction paradigm. By fine-tuning approximately 3% of the backbone parameters, IV-tuning outperforms full fine-tuning and previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple baselines in multiple tasks, including IR-VIS salient object detection, semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IV-tuning achieves superior performance with fewer trainable parameters, providing a good alternative to full fine-tuning and a novel method of extending visible-based models for infrared-visible tasks.

However, recent SSL approaches fail to define pretext tasks that retain geometric information such as object pose and scale, which can be detrimental to the performance of downstream localization and geometry-sensitive 3D scene understanding tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We propose PSA-SSL, a novel extension to point cloud SSL that learns object pose and size-aware (PSA) features. Our approach defines a self-supervised bounding box regression pretext task, which retains object pose and size information. Furthermore, we incorporate LiDAR beam pattern augmentation on input point clouds, which encourages learning sensor-agnostic features. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single pretrained model, our light-weight yet effective extensions achieve significant improvements on 3D semantic segmentation with limited labels across popular autonomous driving datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, SemanticKITTI). Moreover, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art SSL methods on 3D semantic segmentation (using up to 10 times less labels), as well as on 3D object detection.

| **[Exploiting Inherent Class Label: Towards Robust Scribble Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13895v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scribble-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation leverages only a few annotated pixels as labels to train a segmentation model, presenting significant potential for reducing the human labor involved in the annotation process. This approach faces two primary challenges: first, the sparsity of scribble annotations can lead to inconsistent predictions due to limited supervision; second, the variability in scribble annotations, reflecting differing human annotator preferences, can prevent the model from consistently capturing the discriminative regions of objects, potentially leading to unstable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a holistic framework, the class-driven scribble promotion network, for robust scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. This framework not only utilizes the provided scribble annotations but also leverages their associated class labels to generate reliable pseudo-labels. Within the network, we introduce a localization rectification module to mitigate noisy labels and a distance perception module to identify reliable regions surrounding scribble annotations and pseudo-labels. In addition, we introduce new large-scale benchmarks, ScribbleCOCO and ScribbleCityscapes, accompanied by a scribble simulation algorithm that enables evaluation across varying scribble styles. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in both accuracy and robustness, underscoring its superiority over existing approaches. The datasets and the codes will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Let Synthetic Data Shine: Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion for Single Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13617v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to train models with consistent performance across diverse scenarios using data from a single source. While using latent diffusion models (LDMs) show promise in augmenting limited source data, we demonstrate that directly using synthetic data can be detrimental due to significant feature distribution discrepancies between synthetic and real target domains, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Discriminative Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion (DRSF), a training framework leveraging synthetic data to improve model generalization. We employ LDMs to produce diverse pseudo-target domain samples and introduce two key modules to handle distribution bias. First, Discriminative Feature Decoupling and Reassembly (DFDR) module uses entropy-guided attention to recalibrate channel-level features, suppressing synthetic noise while preserving semantic consistency. Second, Multi-pseudo-domain Soft Fusion (MDSF) module uses adversarial training with latent-space feature interpolation, creating continuous feature transitions between domains. Extensive SDG experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that DRSF achieves substantial performance gains with only marginal computational overhead. Notably, DRSF's plug-and-play architecture enables seamless integration with unsupervised domain adaptation paradigms, underscoring its broad applicability in addressing diverse and real-world domain challenges.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures | None |

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of plants (a single trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. Additionally, to efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robotic platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset has been made publicly available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/hops/. We will provide the open-source implementation of our approach and public competiton for hierarchical panoptic segmentation on the hidden test sets upon paper acceptance.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS | None |
| **[DehazeMamba: SAR-guided Optical Remote Sensing Image Dehazing with Adaptive State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13073v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical remote sensing image dehazing presents significant challenges due to its extensive spatial scale and highly non-uniform haze distribution, which traditional single-image dehazing methods struggle to address effectively. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery offers inherently haze-free reference information for large-scale scenes, existing SAR-guided dehazing approaches face two critical limitations: the integration of SAR information often diminishes the quality of haze-free regions, and the instability of feature quality further exacerbates cross-modal domain shift. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DehazeMamba, a novel SAR-guided dehazing network built on a progressive haze decoupling fusion strategy. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a Haze Perception and Decoupling Module (HPDM) that dynamically identifies haze-affected regions through optical-SAR difference analysis, and a Progressive Fusion Module (PFM) that mitigates domain shift through a two-stage fusion process based on feature quality assessment. To facilitate research in this domain, we present MRSHaze, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 8,000 pairs of temporally synchronized, precisely geo-registered SAR-optical images with high resolution and diverse haze conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.73 dB improvement in PSNR and substantial enhancements in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

We propose a novel Cross-modal Sample Selection (CromSS) method, a weakly supervised pretraining strategy designed to improve feature representations through cross-modal consistency and noise mitigation techniques. Unlike conventional pretraining approaches, CromSS exploits massive amounts of noisy and easy-to-come-by labels for improved feature learning beneficial to semantic segmentation tasks. We investigate middle and late fusion strategies to optimize the multi-modal pretraining architecture design. We also introduce a cross-modal sample selection module to mitigate the adverse effects of label noise, which employs a cross-modal entangling strategy to refine the estimated confidence masks within each modality to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we introduce a spatial-temporal label smoothing technique to counteract overconfidence for enhanced robustness against noisy labels. To validate our approach, we assembled the multi-modal dataset, NoLDO-S12, which consists of a large-scale noisy label subset from Google's Dynamic World (DW) dataset for pretraining and two downstream subsets with high-quality labels from Google DW and OpenStreetMap (OSM) for transfer learning. Experimental results on two downstream tasks and the publicly available DFC2020 dataset demonstrate that when effectively utilized, the low-cost noisy labels can significantly enhance feature learning for segmentation tasks. All data, code, and pretrained weights will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 1st short version was accepted as an oral presentation by ICLR 2024 ML4RS workshop.

Aiming at the complex anatomical structure of spinal images, this paper introduces a multi-scale fusion mechanism to enhance the feature extraction capability by using information of different scales, thereby improving the recognition accuracy of the model for the target area. In addition, the introduction of the adaptive attention mechanism enables the model to dynamically adjust the attention to the key area, thereby optimizing the boundary segmentation effect. The experimental results show that compared with 3D CNN, 3D U-Net, and 3D U-Net + Transformer, the model of this study has achieved significant improvements in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc indicators, and has better segmentation performance. The ablation experiment further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed improved method, proving that multi-scale fusion and adaptive attention mechanism have a positive effect on the segmentation task. Through the visualization analysis of the inference results, the model can better restore the real anatomical structure of the spinal image. Future research can further optimize the Transformer structure and expand the data scale to improve the generalization ability of the model. This study provides an efficient solution for the task of medical image segmentation, which is of great significance to intelligent medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Two key approaches in DASS are (1) vision-only approaches using masking or multi-resolution crops, and (2) language-based approaches that use generic class-wise prompts informed by target domain (e.g. "a {snowy} photo of a {class}"). However, the former is susceptible to noisy pseudo-labels that are biased to the source domain. The latter does not fully capture the intricate spatial relationships of objects -- key for dense prediction tasks. To this end, we propose LangDA. LangDA addresses these challenges by, first, learning contextual relationships between objects via VLM-generated scene descriptions (e.g. "a pedestrian is on the sidewalk, and the street is lined with buildings."). Second, LangDA aligns the entire image features with text representation of this context-aware scene caption and learns generalized representations via text. With this, LangDA sets the new state-of-the-art across three DASS benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 2.6%, 1.4% and 3.9%.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a single-view RGB-D-based depth completion framework, TransDiff, that leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models(DDPM) to achieve material-agnostic object grasping in desktop. Specifically, we leverage features extracted from RGB images, including semantic segmentation, edge maps, and normal maps, to condition the depth map generation process. Our method learns an iterative denoising process that transforms a random depth distribution into a depth map, guided by initially refined depth information, ensuring more accurate depth estimation in scenarios involving transparent objects. Additionally, we propose a novel training method to better align the noisy depth and RGB image features, which are used as conditions to refine depth estimation step by step. Finally, we utilized an improved inference process to accelerate the denoising procedure. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks with acceptable inference time.

While unsupervised CIS (UCIS) models aim to reduce the heavy reliance on labor-intensive image annotations, they fail to accurately capture cell boundaries, causing missed detections and poor performance. Recognizing the absence of error-free instances as a key limitation, we present COIN (COnfidence score-guided INstance distillation), a novel annotation-free framework with three key steps: (1) Increasing the sensitivity for the presence of error-free instances via unsupervised semantic segmentation with optimal transport, leveraging its ability to discriminate spatially minor instances, (2) Instance-level confidence scoring to measure the consistency between model prediction and refined mask and identify highly confident instances, offering an alternative to ground truth annotations, and (3) Progressive expansion of confidence with recursive self-distillation. Extensive experiments across six datasets show COIN outperforming existing UCIS methods, even surpassing semi- and weakly-supervised approaches across all metrics on the MoNuSeg and TNBC datasets.

Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited.

While contemporary state-of-the-art techniques predominantly concentrate on elevating the overall performance of 3D semantic segmentation based on general metrics (e.g. mIoU, mAcc, and oAcc), they unfortunately leave the exploration of challenging regions for segmentation mostly neglected. In this paper, we revisit 3D semantic segmentation through a more granular lens, shedding light on subtle complexities that are typically overshadowed by broader performance metrics. Concretely, we have delineated 3D semantic segmentation errors into four comprehensive categories as well as corresponding evaluation metrics tailored to each. Building upon this categorical framework, we introduce an innovative 3D semantic segmentation network called BFANet that incorporates detailed analysis of semantic boundary features. First, we design the boundary-semantic module to decouple point cloud features into semantic and boundary features, and fuse their query queue to enhance semantic features with attention. Second, we introduce a more concise and accelerated boundary pseudo-label calculation algorithm, which is 3.9 times faster than the state-of-the-art, offering compatibility with data augmentation and enabling efficient computation in training. Extensive experiments on benchmark data indicate the superiority of our BFANet model, confirming the significance of emphasizing the four uniquely designed metrics.

However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

To this end, we take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowledge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for semantic segmentation. Specifically, Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the low-level features with iterative Laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge, and Texture Intensity Equalization Module (TIEM) is designed to extract and enhance the statistical texture knowledge with the corresponding Quantization Congruence Loss (QDL). Moreover, we propose the Co-occurrence TIEM (C-TIEM) and generic segmentation frameworks, namely STLNet++ and U-SSNet, to enable existing segmentation networks to harvest the structural and statistical texture information more effectively.

In this work, we provide a new evaluation procedure consisting of 1) a cue-decomposition method that comprises two AI-free data pre-processing methods extracting shape and texture cues, respectively, and 2) a novel cue-decomposition shape bias evaluation metric that leverages the cue-decomposition data. For application purposes we introduce a corresponding cue-decomposition robustness metric that allows for the estimation of the robustness of a DNN w.r.t. image corruptions. In our numerical experiments, our findings for biases in image classification DNNs align with those of previous evaluation metrics. However, our cue-decomposition robustness metric shows superior results in terms of estimating the robustness of DNNs. Furthermore, our results for DNNs on the semantic segmentation datasets Cityscapes and ADE20k for the first time shed light into the biases of semantic segmentation DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03944v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing knowledge distillation works for semantic segmentation mainly focus on transferring high-level contextual knowledge from teacher to student. However, low-level texture knowledge is also of vital importance for characterizing the local structural pattern and global statistical property, such as boundary, smoothness, regularity and color contrast, which may not be well addressed by high-level deep features. In this paper, we are intended to take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowledge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for semantic segmentation. Specifically, for structural texture knowledge, we introduce a Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) that decomposes low-level features with iterative Laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge. For statistical knowledge, we propose a Denoised Texture Intensity Equalization Module (DTIEM) to adaptively extract and enhance statistical texture knowledge through heuristics iterative quantization and denoised operation. Finally, each knowledge learning is supervised by an individual loss function, forcing the student network to mimic the teacher better from a broader perspective. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2022.

| **[Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17150v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast to prior refinement techniques that are tailored to specific models or tasks in a close-world manner, we propose SAMRefiner, a universal and efficient approach by adapting SAM to the mask refinement task. The core technique of our model is the noise-tolerant prompting scheme. Specifically, we introduce a multi-prompt excavation strategy to mine diverse input prompts for SAM (i.e., distance-guided points, context-aware elastic bounding boxes, and Gaussian-style masks) from initial coarse masks. These prompts can collaborate with each other to mitigate the effect of defects in coarse masks. In particular, considering the difficulty of SAM to handle the multi-object case in semantic segmentation, we introduce a split-then-merge (STM) pipeline. Additionally, we extend our method to SAMRefiner++ by introducing an additional IoU adaption step to further boost the performance of the generic SAMRefiner on the target dataset. This step is self-boosted and requires no additional annotation. The proposed framework is versatile and can flexibly cooperate with existing segmentation methods. We evaluate our mask framework on a wide range of benchmarks under different settings, demonstrating better accuracy and efficiency. SAMRefiner holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of refinement tools.

Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve 2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC, 3.11% in F1 score, 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index. Additionally, integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields 0.5 to 0.7 improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset, and 0.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

The decoder subsequently processes these features to generate pixel-level predictions. However, due to structural differences and variations in input data, only encoders benefit from pre-learned representations from vision benchmarks such as image classification and self-supervised learning, while decoders are typically trained from scratch. In this paper, we introduce $\times$Net, which facilitates a "pre-trained encoder $\times$ pre-trained decoder" collaboration through three innovative designs. $\times$Net enables the direct utilization of pre-trained models within the decoder, integrating pre-learned representations into the decoding process to enhance performance in dense prediction tasks. By simply coupling the pre-trained encoder and pre-trained decoder, $\times$Net distinguishes itself as a highly promising approach. Remarkably, it achieves this without relying on decoding-specific structures or task-specific algorithms. Despite its streamlined design, $\times$Net outperforms advanced methods in tasks such as monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance particularly in monocular depth estimation. and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially in monocular depth estimation. embedding algorithms.

Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a data-fusion teacher network into a single-modal student network is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This article delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse ''X'' (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single, fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two novel techniques: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, the complex deep space environment, diverse imaging conditions, and high variability in spacecraft morphology pose significant challenges to traditional segmentation methods. This paper proposes SpaceSeg, an innovative vision foundation model-based segmentation framework with four core technical innovations: First, the Multi-Scale Hierarchical Attention Refinement Decoder (MSHARD) achieves high-precision feature decoding through cross-resolution feature fusion via hierarchical attention. Second, the Multi-spacecraft Connected Component Analysis (MS-CCA) effectively resolves topological structure confusion in dense targets. Third, the Spatial Domain Adaptation Transform framework (SDAT) eliminates cross-domain disparities and resist spatial sensor perturbations through composite enhancement strategies. Finally, a custom Multi-Spacecraft Segmentation Task Loss Function is created to significantly improve segmentation robustness in deep space scenarios. To support algorithm validation, we construct the first multi-scale on-orbit multi-spacecraft semantic segmentation dataset SpaceES, which covers four types of spatial backgrounds and 17 typical spacecraft targets. In testing, SpaceSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 89.87$\%$ mIoU and 99.98$\%$ mAcc, surpassing existing best methods by 5.71 percentage points.

However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This paper presents SERN (Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation), a novel framework integrating virtual and physical environments for real-time collaborative decision-making in multi-robot systems. SERN addresses key challenges in asset deployment and coordination through our bi-directional SERN ROS Bridge communication framework. Our approach advances the SOTA through: accurate real-world representation in virtual environments using Unity high-fidelity simulator; synchronization of physical and virtual robot movements; efficient ROS data distribution between remote locations; and integration of SOTA semantic segmentation for enhanced environmental perception. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Metric Cost Function (MMCF) that dynamically balances latency, reliability, computational overhead, and bandwidth consumption to optimize system performance in contested environments. We further provide theoretical justification for synchronization accuracy by proving that the positional error between physical and virtual robots remains bounded under varying network conditions. Our evaluations show a 15% to 24% improvement in latency and up to a 15% increase in processing efficiency compared to traditional ROS setups. Real-world and virtual simulation experiments with multiple robots (Clearpath Jackal and Husky) demonstrate synchronization accuracy, achieving less than $5\text{ cm}$ positional error and under $2^\circ$ rotational error. These results highlight SERN's potential to enhance situational awareness and multi-agent coordination in diverse, contested environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10392v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  | None |

A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential.

However, OVS methods typically require a human in the loop to specify the vocabulary based on the task or dataset at hand. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (AVS), advancing open-ended image understanding by eliminating the necessity to predefine object categories for segmentation. Our approach, AutoSeg, presents a framework that autonomously identifies relevant class names using semantically enhanced BLIP embeddings and segments them afterwards. Given that open-ended object category predictions cannot be directly compared with a fixed ground truth, we develop a Large Language Model-based Auto-Vocabulary Evaluator (LAVE) to efficiently evaluate the automatically generated classes and their corresponding segments. With AVS, our method sets new benchmarks on datasets PASCAL VOC, Context, ADE20K, and Cityscapes, while showing competitive performance to OVS methods that require specified class names.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, ControlNet enables precise alignment between ground truth segmentation masks and the generated image content, allowing the enhancement of training datasets in segmentation tasks. This raises a key question: Can ControlNet additionally be guided to generate the most informative synthetic samples for a specific task? Inspired by active learning, where the most informative real-world samples are selected based on sample difficulty or model uncertainty, we propose the first approach to integrate active learning-based selection metrics into the backward diffusion process for sample generation. Specifically, we explore uncertainty, query by committee, and expected model change, which are commonly used in active learning, and demonstrate their application for guiding the sample generation process through gradient approximation. Our method is training-free, modifying only the backward diffusion process, allowing it to be used on any pretrained ControlNet. Using this process, we show that segmentation models trained with guided synthetic data outperform those trained on non-guided synthetic data. Our work underscores the need for advanced control mechanisms for diffusion-based models, which are not only aligned with image content but additionally downstream task performance, highlighting the true potential of synthetic data generation.</p></details> |  | None |

We take a bottom-up approach in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation. Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train, achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods. Further, FAST-Splat achieves relatively similar or better semantic segmentation performance compared to existing methods. After the review period, we will provide links to the project website and the codebase.</p></details> |  | None |

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement.

At the same time, large-scale pretraining without labels of so-called Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), has also significantly improved downstream generalization. This motivates us to research how UDA can best utilize the benefits of VFMs. The earlier work of VFM-UDA showed that beyond state-of-the-art (SotA) results can be obtained by replacing non-VFM with VFM encoders in SotA UDA methods. In this work, we take it one step further and improve on the UDA architecture and data strategy themselves. We observe that VFM-UDA, the current SotA UDA method, does not use multi-scale inductive biases or feature distillation losses, while it is known that these can improve generalization. We address both limitations in VFM-UDA++ and obtain beyond SotA generalization on standard UDA benchmarks of up to +5.3 mIoU. Inspired by work on VFM fine-tuning, such as Rein, we also explore the benefits of adding more easy-to-generate synthetic source data with easy-to-obtain unlabeled target data and realize a +6.6 mIoU over the current SotA. The improvements of VFM-UDA++ are most significant for smaller models, however, we show that for larger models, the obtained generalization is only 2.8 mIoU from that of fully-supervised learning with all target labels. Based on these strong results, we provide essential insights to help researchers and practitioners advance UDA.</p></details> |  | None |

Building on this, we extend diffusion models to point cloud semantic segmentation, where point positions also remain fixed, and the diffusion model generates point labels instead of colors. To accelerate the denoising process in reverse diffusion, we introduce a noisy label embedding mechanism. This approach integrates semantic information into the noisy label, providing an initial semantic reference that improves the reverse diffusion efficiency. Additionally, we propose a point frequency transformer that enhances the adjustment of high-level context in point clouds. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce the position condition into MLP and propose denoising PointNet to process the high-resolution point cloud without sacrificing geometric details. Finally, we integrate the proposed noisy label embedding, point frequency transformer and denoising PointNet in our proposed dual conditional diffusion model-based network (PointDiffuse) to perform large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PointDiffuse, achieving the state-of-the-art mIoU of 74.2\% on S3DIS Area 5, 81.2\% on S3DIS 6-fold and 64.8\% on SWAN dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[SegDesicNet: Lightweight Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing with Geo-Coordinate Embeddings for Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08290v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is essential for analyzing highdefinition remote sensing images (HRSIs) because it allows the precise classification of objects and regions at the pixel level. However, remote sensing data present challenges owing to geographical location, weather, and environmental variations, making it difficult for semantic segmentation models to generalize across diverse scenarios. Existing methods are often limited to specific data domains and require expert annotators and specialized equipment for semantic labeling. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation technique for remote sensing semantic segmentation by utilizing geographical coordinates that are readily accessible in remote sensing setups as metadata in a dataset. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a novel approach that considers the combination of an image\'s location encoding trait and the spherical nature of Earth\'s surface. Our proposed SegDesicNet module regresses the GRID positional encoding of the geo coordinates projected over the unit sphere to obtain the domain loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SegDesicNet outperforms state of the art domain adaptation methods in remote sensing image segmentation, achieving an improvement of approximately ~6% in the mean intersection over union (MIoU) with a ~ 27\% drop in parameter count on benchmarked subsets of the publicly available FLAIR #1 dataset. We also benchmarked our method performance on the custom split of the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Our algorithm seeks to reduce the modeling disparity between artificial neural networks and human comprehension of the physical world, making the technology more human centric and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025/papers/Verma_SegDesicNet_Lightweight_Semantic_Segmentation_in_Remote_Sensing_with_Geo-Coordinate_Embeddings_WACV_2025_paper.pdf</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffEGG: Diffusion-Driven Edge Generation as a Pixel-Annotation-Free Alternative for Instance Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07982v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise panoptic segmentation relies on pixel-wise instance annotations, but obtaining such datasets is costly. Unsupervised instance segmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with adjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the limitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues. Weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using sparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and introduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free method that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models to generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods, diffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features, enabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates annotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual supervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods. Additionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses DiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner. RIP allows DiffEGG to be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation frameworks. When applied to UIS, DiffEGG and RIP achieve an average $+4.4\text{ AP}$ improvement over prior best UIS methods. When combined with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSS), DiffEGG enables WPS without instance annotations, outperforming prior best point-supervised WPS methods by $+1.7\text{ PQ}$. These results demonstrate that DiffEGG's edge maps serve as a cost-effective, annotation-free alternative to instance annotations, significantly improving segmentation without human intervention.

Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\times$ faster than baseline methods.

However, existing algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks and directly applying them to Vision Transformers poses certain limitations due to conceptual disparities. To this end, we propose TokenMix, a data augmentation technique specifically designed for semi-supervised semantic segmentation with Vision Transformers. TokenMix aligns well with the global attention mechanism by mixing images at the token level, enhancing learning capability for contextual information among image patches. We further incorporate image augmentation and feature augmentation to promote the diversity of augmentation. Moreover, to enhance consistency regularization, we propose a dual-branch framework where each branch applies image and feature augmentation to the input image. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including Pascal VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO. Results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with notably observed accuracy improvement, especially under limited fine annotations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07252v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniSAM: Omnidirectional Segment Anything Model for UDA in Panoramic Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07098v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has emerged as a strong base model in various pinhole imaging segmentation tasks. However, when applying it to $360^\circ$ domain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole ($70^\circ \times 70^\circ$) and panoramic images ($180^\circ \times 360^\circ$) poses unique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1) inevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity between domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the original SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel OmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic semantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first divides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated as image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then leverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences that embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the prediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM fine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for semantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic pseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of memory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability across different sizes of source models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniSAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, e.g., 79.06% (+10.22%) on SPin8-to-SPan8, 62.46% (+6.58%) on CS13-to-DP13.</p></details> |  | None |

A straightforward zero-avoiding KL-divergence loss for average predictions produces segmentation accuracy comparable to the standard pixel-precise supervision with full ground truth masks. In contrast, current results based on class tags typically require complex non-reproducible architectural modifications and specialized multi-stage training procedures. Our ideas are validated on PASCAL VOC using our new human annotations of approximate object sizes. We also show the results on COCO and medical data using synthetically corrupted size targets. All standard networks demonstrate robustness to the size targets' errors. For some classes, the validation accuracy is significantly better than the pixel-level supervision; the latter is not robust to errors in the masks. Our work provides new ideas and insights on image-level supervision in segmentation and may encourage other simple general solutions to the problem.</p></details> |  | None |

Promising shape representations enable computers to interpret a shape with meaningful parts and identify their repeatability. However, supervised shape representations depend on costly annotation efforts, while current unsupervised methods work under strong semantic priors and involve multi-stage training, thereby limiting their generalization and deployment in shape reasoning and understanding. Driven by the tendency of high-dimensional semantically similar features to lie in or near low-dimensional subspaces, we introduce a one-stage, fully unsupervised framework towards semantic-aware shape representation. This framework produces joint instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and shape abstraction through sparse representation and feature alignment of object parts in a high-dimensional space. For sparse representation, we devise a sparse latent membership pursuit method that models each object part feature as a sparse convex combination of point features at either the semantic or instance level, promoting part features in the same subspace to exhibit similar semantics. For feature alignment, we customize an attention-based strategy in the feature space to align instance- and semantic-level object part features and reconstruct the input shape using both of them, ensuring geometric reusability and semantic consistency of object parts. To firm up semantic disambiguation, we construct cascade unfrozen learning on geometric parameters of object parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.

However, the complex and highly dynamic nature of traffic environments presents significant challenges in accurately rendering these scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach, which incorporates context and temporal deformation awareness to improve dynamic scene rendering. Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, CoDa-4DGS deforms semantic features with each Gaussian, enabling broader applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents an innovative approach to leverage intermediate spatial representations. Our analysis of the intermediate features from both teacher and student models reveals two pivotal insights: (1) the similar features between students and teachers are predominantly focused on foreground objects. (2) teacher models emphasize foreground objects more than students. Building on these findings, we propose Asymmetric Decision-Making (ADM) to enhance feature consensus learning for student models while continuously promoting feature diversity in teacher models. Specifically, Consensus Learning for student models prioritizes spatial features with high consensus relative to teacher models. Conversely, Divergence Learning for teacher models highlights spatial features with lower similarity compared to student models, indicating superior performance by teacher models in these regions. Consequently, ADM facilitates the student models to catch up with the feature learning process of the teacher models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADM consistently surpasses existing OKD methods across various online knowledge distillation settings and also achieves superior results when applied to offline knowledge distillation, semantic segmentation and diffusion distillation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Branched DepthwiseConv (Trans-BDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance.

While standard loss functions such as cross-entropy and Dice loss perform well in general cases, they often struggle with fine structures, particularly in tasks involving thin structures or closely packed objects. Various weight map-based loss functions have been proposed to address this issue by assigning higher loss weights to pixels prone to misclassification. However, these methods typically rely on precomputed or runtime-generated weight maps based on distance transforms, which impose significant computational costs and fail to adapt to evolving network predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel steerable pyramid-based weighted (SPW) loss function that efficiently generates adaptive weight maps. Unlike traditional boundary-aware losses that depend on static or iteratively updated distance maps, our method leverages steerable pyramids to dynamically emphasize regions across multiple frequency bands (capturing features at different scales) while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, by incorporating network predictions into the weight computation, our approach enables adaptive refinement during training. We evaluate our method on the SNEMI3D, GlaS, and DRIVE datasets, benchmarking it against 11 state-of-the-art loss functions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPW loss function achieves superior pixel precision and segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. This work provides an effective and efficient solution for improving semantic segmentation, particularly for applications requiring multiscale feature representation.

Segmentation of white matter (WM) tracts using 3D neuroimages is vital for understanding the brain's structural connectivity in both healthy and diseased states. One-shot Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (OCIS) refers to effectively segmenting new (novel) classes using only a single sample while retaining knowledge of old (base) classes without forgetting. Voxel-contrastive OCIS methods adjust the feature space to alleviate the feature overlap problem between the base and novel classes. However, since WM tract segmentation is a multi-label segmentation task, existing single-label voxel contrastive-based methods may cause inherent contradictions. To address this, we propose a new multi-label voxel contrast framework called MultiCo3D for one-shot class incremental tract segmentation. Our method utilizes uncertainty distillation to preserve base tract segmentation knowledge while adjusting the feature space with multi-label voxel contrast to alleviate feature overlap when learning novel tracts and dynamically weighting multi losses to balance overall loss. We compare our method against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The experimental results show that our method significantly enhances one-shot class incremental tract segmentation accuracy across five different experimental setups on HCP and Preto datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, most of the existing deep learning models for semantic segmentation are based on the encoder-decoder architecture including U-net and Segment Anything Model (SAM), where the downsampling process tends to discard fine details. In this paper, we propose a new approach that integrates learnable morphological skeleton prior into deep neural networks using the variational method. To address the difficulty in backpropagation in neural networks caused by the non-differentiability presented in classical morphological operations, we provide a smooth representation of the morphological skeleton and design a variational segmentation model integrating morphological skeleton prior by employing operator splitting and dual methods. Then, we integrate this model into the network architecture of SAM, which is achieved by adding a token to mask decoder and modifying the final sigmoid layer, ensuring the final segmentation results preserve the skeleton structure as much as possible. Experimental results on remote sensing datasets, including buildings, roads and water, demonstrate that our method outperforms the original SAM on slender object segmentation and exhibits better generalization capability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing mapping methods often suffer from overconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading to inconsistent map representations. In this paper, we therefore introduce EvidMTL, a multi-task learning framework that uses evidential heads for depth estimation and semantic segmentation, enabling uncertainty-aware inference from monocular RGB images. To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task learning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly optimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with evidential segmentation loss.

We train and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot performance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In zero-shot mapping tests on ScanNetV2, EvidKimera outperforms Kimera in semantic surface mapping accuracy and consistency, highlighting the benefits of uncertainty-aware mapping and underscoring its potential for real-world robotic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025 Conference</p></details> | None |
| **[ACAM-KD: Adaptive and Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06307v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense visual prediction tasks, such as detection and segmentation, are crucial for time-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving and video surveillance). While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over the baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Test-Time Optimization for Domain Adaptive Open Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04696v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Seg-TTO, a novel framework for zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS), designed to excel in specialized domain tasks. While current open-vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-and-play module. We integrate Seg-TTO with three state-of-the-art OVSS approaches and evaluate across 22 challenging OVSS tasks covering a range of specialized domains. Our Seg-TTO demonstrates clear performance improvements (up to 27% mIoU increase on some datasets) establishing new state-of-the-art. Our code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  | None |

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

The results highlight the trade-offs between these platforms and toolchains, with a particular focus on the practical deployment challenges in real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate that while the FPGA with Vitis AI emerges as the superior choice due to its performance, energy efficiency, and maturity, it requires specialized hardware knowledge, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in selecting embedded computing solutions for semantic segmentation tasks</p></details> | <details><summary>ERTS2...</summary><p>ERTS2024, Jun 2024, Toulouse, France</p></details> | None |

Despite advancements in attack methods for semantic segmentation, transferability remains limited, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce the Feature Similarity Projected Gradient Descent (FSPGD) attack, a novel black-box approach that enhances both attack performance and transferability. Unlike conventional segmentation attacks that rely on output predictions for gradient calculation, FSPGD computes gradients from intermediate layer features. Specifically, our method introduces a loss function that targets local information by comparing features between clean images and adversarial examples, while also disrupting contextual information by accounting for spatial relationships between objects. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that FSPGD achieves superior transferability and attack performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.

One key task is the accurate semantic segmentation of different plant material within point clouds, particularly wood and leaves, which is required to understand plant productivity, architecture and physiology. Existing automated semantic segmentation methods are primarily developed for single ecosystem types, and whilst they show good accuracy for biomass assessment from the trunk and large branches, often perform less well within the crown. In this study, we demonstrate a new framework that uses a deep learning architecture newly developed from PointNet and pointNEXT for processing 3D point clouds to provide a reliable semantic segmentation of wood and leaf in TLS point clouds from the tree base to branch tips, trained on data from diverse mature European forests. Our model uses meticulously labelled data combined with voxel-based sampling, neighbourhood rescaling, and a novel gated reflectance integration module embedded throughout the feature extraction layers. We evaluate its performance across open datasets from boreal, temperate, Mediterranean and tropical regions, encompassing diverse ecosystem types and sensor characteristics. Our results show consistent outperformance against the most widely used PointNet based approach for leaf/wood segmentation on our high-density TLS dataset collected across diverse mixed forest plots across all major biomes in Europe. We also find consistently strong performance tested on others open data from China, Eastern Cameroon, Germany and Finland, collected using both time-of-flight and phase-shift sensors, showcasing the transferability of our model to a wide range of ecosystems and sensors.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, conventional monocular visual odometry encoun-ters challenges in scale estimation due to the absence of depth information during projection. Previous methodologies, whether rooted in physical constraints or deep learning paradigms, con-tend with issues related to computational complexity and the management of dynamic objects. This study extends our prior research, presenting innovative strategies for ego-motion estima-tion and the selection of ground points. Striving for a nuanced equilibrium between computational efficiency and precision, we propose a hybrid method that leverages the SegNeXt model for real-time applications, encompassing both ego-motion estimation and ground point selection. Our methodology incorporates dy-namic object masks to eliminate unstable features and employs ground plane masks for meticulous triangulation. Furthermore, we exploit Geometry-constraint to delineate road regions for scale recovery. The integration of this approach with the mo-nocular version of ORB-SLAM3 culminates in the accurate esti-mation of a road model, a pivotal component in our scale recov-ery process. Rigorous experiments, conducted on the KITTI da-taset, systematically compare our method with existing monocu-lar visual odometry algorithms and contemporary scale recovery methodologies. The results undeniably confirm the superior ef-fectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.

However, plenty of studies focus on designing complex modules to fuse different modalities. With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), valuable information can be more effectively extracted from natural language. Therefore, we aim to leverage the advantages of large language models to design a structurally simple and highly adaptable multimodal fusion model architecture. We proposed MultimodAl Segmentation with TExt PRompts (MASTER) architecture, which integrates LLM into the fusion of RGB-Thermal multimodal data and allows complex query text to participate in the fusion process. Our model utilizes a dual-path structure to extract information from different modalities of images. Additionally, we employ LLM as the core module for multimodal fusion, enabling the model to generate learnable codebook tokens from RGB, thermal images, and textual information. A lightweight image decoder is used to obtain semantic segmentation results. The proposed MASTER performs exceptionally well in benchmark tests across various automated driving scenarios, yielding promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there is falls short of simulating complex real-world ITS scenarios, primarily due to the lack of a digital twin implementation framework for characterizing interactions between pedestrians and vehicles at different locations in different traffic environments. In this article, we propose a surveillance video assisted federated digital twin (SV-FDT) framework to empower ITSs with pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop. Specifically, SVFDT builds comprehensive pedestrian-vehicle interaction models by leveraging multi-source traffic surveillance videos. Its architecture consists of three layers: (i) the end layer, which collects traffic surveillance videos from multiple sources; (ii) the edge layer, responsible for semantic segmentation-based visual understanding, twin agent-based interaction modeling, and local digital twin system (LDTS) creation in local regions; and (iii) the cloud layer, which integrates LDTSs across different regions to construct a global DT model in realtime. We analyze key design requirements and challenges and present core guidelines for SVFDT's system implementation. A testbed evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing traffic management. Comparisons with traditional terminal-server frameworks highlight SV-FDT's advantages in mirroring delays, recognition accuracy, and subjective evaluation. Finally, we identify some open challenges and discuss future research directions.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods, however, are computationally expensive, requiring costly attention-based 2D-3D transformation and 3D feature processing. In this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, H3O, which features highly efficient architecture designs that incur a significantly lower computational cost as compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, to compensate for the ambiguity in ground-truth 3D occupancy labels, we advocate leveraging auxiliary tasks to complement the direct 3D supervision. In particular, we integrate multi-camera depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and surface normal estimation via differentiable volume rendering, supervised by corresponding 2D labels that introduces rich and heterogeneous supervision signals. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed H3O.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |

However, existing methods primarily focus on embedding compressed CLIP features to 3D Gaussians, suffering from low object segmentation accuracy and lack spatial reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose GaussianGraph, a novel framework that enhances 3DGS-based scene understanding by integrating adaptive semantic clustering and scene graph generation. We introduce a "Control-Follow" clustering strategy, which dynamically adapts to scene scale and feature distribution, avoiding feature compression and significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Additionally, we enrich scene representation by integrating object attributes and spatial relations extracted from 2D foundation models. To address inaccuracies in spatial relationships, we propose 3D correction modules that filter implausible relations through spatial consistency verification, ensuring reliable scene graph construction. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GaussianGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic segmentation and object grounding tasks, providing a robust solution for complex scene understanding and interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current FSS methods frequently struggle with generalization due to incomplete and biased feature representations, especially when support images do not capture the full appearance variability of the target class. To improve the FSS pipeline, we propose a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to adapt general class semantic information to the query image. Furthermore, the framework employs dense pixel-wise matching to identify similarities between query and support images, resulting in enhanced FSS performance. Inspired by reasoning-based segmentation frameworks, our method, named DSV-LFS, introduces an additional token into the LLM vocabulary, allowing a multimodal LLM to generate a "semantic prompt" from class descriptions. In parallel, a dense matching module identifies visual similarities between the query and support images, generating a "visual prompt". These prompts are then jointly employed to guide the prompt-based decoder for accurate segmentation of the query image. Comprehensive experiments on the benchmark datasets Pascal-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance-by a significant margin-demonstrating superior generalization to novel classes and robustness across diverse scenarios.

However, scarce densely labeled semantic data limits generalization across domains. Simulated data helps, but introduces domain adaptation issues. We propose COARSE, a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for off-road semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse, coarse in-domain labels and densely labeled out-of-domain data. Using pretrained vision transformers, we bridge domain gaps with complementary pixel-level and patch-level decoders, enhanced by a collaborative pseudo-labeling strategy on unlabeled data. Evaluations on RUGD and Rellis-3D datasets show significant improvements of 9.7\% and 8.4\% respectively, versus only using coarse data. Tests on real-world off-road vehicle data in a multi-biome setting further demonstrate COARSE's applicability.</p></details> | preprint, 8 pages | None |

Methods: We utilized five public datasets to evaluate and fine-tune SAM 2 for segmenting anatomical tissues in surgical videos/images. Fine-tuning was applied to the image encoder and mask decoder. We limited training subsets from 50 to 400 samples per class to better model real-world constraints with data acquisition. The impact of dataset size on fine-tuning performance was evaluated with weighted mean Dice coefficient (WMDC), and the results were also compared against previously reported state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Results: SurgiSAM 2, a fine-tuned SAM 2 model, demonstrated significant improvements in segmentation performance, achieving a 17.9% relative WMDC gain compared to the baseline SAM 2. Increasing prompt points from 1 to 10 and training data scale from 50/class to 400/class enhanced performance; the best WMDC of 0.92 on the validation subset was achieved with 10 prompt points and 400 samples per class. On the test subset, this model outperformed prior SOTA methods in 24/30 (80%) of the classes with a WMDC of 0.91 using 10-point prompts. Notably, SurgiSAM 2 generalized effectively to unseen organ classes, achieving SOTA on 7/9 (77.8%) of them. Conclusion: SAM 2 achieves remarkable zero-shot and fine-tuned performance for surgical scene segmentation, surpassing prior SOTA models across several organ classes of diverse datasets. This suggests immense potential for enabling automated/semi-automated annotation pipelines, thereby decreasing the burden of annotations facilitating several surgical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, most point cloud segmentation architectures incorporate custom network layers, limiting the transferability of advances from vision-based architectures. Inspired by recent advances in universal foundation models, we propose BALViT, a novel approach that leverages frozen vision models as amodal feature encoders for learning strong LiDAR encoders. Specifically, BALViT incorporates both range-view and bird's-eye-view LiDAR encoding mechanisms, which we combine through a novel 2D-3D adapter. While the range-view features are processed through a frozen image backbone, our bird's-eye-view branch enhances them through multiple cross-attention interactions. Thereby, we continuously improve the vision network with domain-dependent knowledge, resulting in a strong label-efficient LiDAR encoding mechanism. Extensive evaluations of BALViT on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on small data regimes.

However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling.

Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters.

Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed.

In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous data collection from the open-source CARLA simulator using multiple sensors attached to vehicle based on user-defined criteria. We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |

However, effectively integrating fine-grained perception tasks like detection and segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. This is primarily because these tasks often rely heavily on task-specific designs and architectures that can complicate the modeling process. To address this challenge, we present \ours, a framework that \textbf{U}nifies \textbf{F}ine-grained visual perception tasks through an \textbf{O}pen-ended language interface. By transforming all perception targets into the language space, \ours unifies object-level detection, pixel-level segmentation, and image-level vision-language tasks into a single model. Additionally, we introduce a novel embedding retrieval approach that relies solely on the language interface to support segmentation tasks. Our framework bridges the gap between fine-grained perception and vision-language tasks, significantly simplifying architectural design and training strategies while achieving comparable or superior performance to methods with intricate task-specific designs. After multi-task training on five standard visual perception datasets, \ours outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generalist models by 12.3 mAP on COCO instance segmentation and 3.3 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our method seamlessly integrates with existing MLLMs, effectively combining fine-grained perception capabilities with their advanced language abilities, thereby enabling more challenging tasks such as reasoning segmentation.

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

| **[3D-AffordanceLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Affordance Detection in 3D Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20041v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Affordance detection is a challenging problem with broad applications on various robotic tasks. Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.</p></details> | ICLR | None |
| **[Locality Alignment Improves Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11087v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this with a vision backbone that effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability - pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at patch-level semantic segmentation, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure benefits VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-Ready</p></details> | None |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  | None |

Identity documents recognition, classification, detection, and localization are the tasks required in a number of applications, particularly, in physical access control security systems at critical infrastructure premises. In this paper, we propose the new original architecture of a model based on an artificial convolutional neural network and semantic segmentation approach for the recognition and detection of identity documents in images. The challenge with the processing of such images is the limited computational performance and the limited amount of memory when such an application is running on industrial oneboard microcomputer hardware. The aim of this research is to prove the feasibility of the proposed technique and to obtain quality metrics. The methodology of the research is to evaluate the deep learning detection model trained on the mobile identity document video dataset. The dataset contains five hundred video clips for fifty different identity document types. The numerical results from simulations are used to evaluate the quality metrics. We present the results as accuracy versus threshold of the intersection over union value. The paper reports an accuracy above 0.75 for the intersection over union (IoU) threshold value of 0.8. Besides, we assessed the size of the model and proved the feasibility of running the model on an industrial one-board microcomputer or smartphone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Using Synthetic Images to Augment Small Medical Image Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00962v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing academic and industrial interest in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging. To perform well, DL models require very large labeled datasets. However, most medical imaging datasets are small, with a limited number of annotated samples. The reason they are small is usually because delineating medical images is time-consuming and demanding for oncologists. There are various techniques that can be used to augment a dataset, for example, to apply affine transformations or elastic transformations to available images, or to add synthetic images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In this work, we have developed a novel conditional variant of a current GAN method, the StyleGAN2, to generate multi-modal high-resolution medical images with the purpose to augment small medical imaging datasets with these synthetic images. We use the synthetic and real images from six datasets to train models for the downstream task of semantic segmentation. The quality of the generated medical images and the effect of this augmentation on the segmentation performance were evaluated afterward. Finally, the results indicate that the downstream segmentation models did not benefit from the generated images. Further work and analyses are required to establish how this augmentation affects the segmentation performance.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

Despite the growing interest in using deep learning models for BEV semantic segmentation, anticipating segmentation errors and enhancing the explainability of these models remain underexplored. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for predictive uncertainty quantification in BEV segmentation, evaluating multiple uncertainty quantification methods across three popular datasets with three representative network architectures. Our study focuses on the effectiveness of quantified uncertainty in detecting misclassified and out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels while also improving model calibration. Through empirical analysis, we uncover challenges in existing uncertainty quantification methods and demonstrate the potential of evidential deep learning techniques, which capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose a novel loss function, Uncertainty-Focal-Cross-Entropy (UFCE), specifically designed for highly imbalanced data, along with a simple uncertainty-scaling regularization term that improves both uncertainty quantification and model calibration for BEV segmentation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

FoP is built upon three core features--projection difference, adjacency divergence, and contextual consistency--which are essential for cross-task adaptability. To implement FoP, we design a two-step angular adapter: the first step captures angular-specific differences, while the second step consolidates contextual consistency to ensure robust representation. Leveraging the FoP-based representation, we introduce the LFX framework, the first to handle arbitrary LF representations seamlessly, unifying LF multi-task vision. We evaluated LFX across three different tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, compared with previous task-specific architectures: 84.74% in mIoU for semantic segmentation on UrbanLF, 0.84% in AP for object detection on PKU, and 0.030 in MAE and 0.026 in MAE for salient object detection on Duftv2 and PKU, respectively.

In this paper, we present an advanced, explainable machine learning method that utilizes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for effective wake vortex detection. Our method leverages a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN) with semantic segmentation to partition a 3D LiDAR point cloud into meaningful segments. Further refinement is achieved through clustering techniques. A novel feature of our research is the use of a perturbation-based explanation technique, which clarifies the model's decision-making processes for air traffic regulators and controllers, increasing transparency and building trust. Our experimental results, based on measured and simulated LiDAR scans compared against four baseline methods, underscore the effectiveness and reliability of our approach. This combination of semantic segmentation and clustering for real-time wake vortex tracking significantly advances aviation safety measures, ensuring that these are both effective and comprehensible.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2025 | None |
| **[Erase, then Redraw: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach for Free Space Detection Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20164v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is one of the most common tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances including tasks such as classification, detection, and semantic segmentation. The standard approach to data augmentation involves simple transformations like rotation and flipping to generate new images. However, these new images often lack diversity along the main semantic dimensions within the data. Traditional data augmentation methods cannot alter high-level semantic attributes such as the presence of vehicles, trees, and buildings in a scene to enhance data diversity. In recent years, the rapid development of generative models has injected new vitality into the field of data augmentation. In this paper, we address the lack of diversity in data augmentation for road detection task by using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to parameterize image-to-image transformations. Our method involves editing images using these diffusion models to change their semantics. In essence, we achieve this goal by erasing instances of real objects from the original dataset and generating new instances with similar semantics in the erased regions using the diffusion model, thereby expanding the original dataset. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI road dataset and achieve the best results compared to other data augmentation methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed development.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks.

When detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to 0.565.</p></details> |  | None |

However, point clouds from LiDARs used in automated driving are particularly challenging for MAEs since large areas of the 3D volume are empty. Consequently, existing work suffers from leaking occupancy information into the decoder and has significant computational complexity, thereby limiting the SSL pre-training to only 2D bird's eye view encoders in practice. In this work, we propose the novel neighborhood occupancy MAE (NOMAE) that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by employing masked occupancy reconstruction only in the neighborhood of non-masked voxels. We incorporate voxel masking and occupancy reconstruction at multiple scales with our proposed hierarchical mask generation technique to capture features of objects of different sizes in the point cloud. NOMAEs are extremely flexible and can be directly employed for SSL in existing 3D architectures. We perform extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets for the downstream perception tasks of semantic segmentation and 3D object detection, comparing with both discriminative and generative SSL methods. The results demonstrate that NOMAE sets the new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks for multiple point cloud perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent efforts in ConvNet designs primarily focused on increasing kernel size to obtain a larger receptive field without considering this crucial biomimetic mechanism to further improve performance. To this end, we propose a novel pure ConvNet vision backbone, termed OverLoCK, which is carefully devised from both the architecture and mixer perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a biomimetic Deep-stage Decomposition Strategy (DDS) that fuses semantically meaningful context representations into middle and deep layers by providing dynamic top-down context guidance at both feature and kernel weight levels. To fully unleash the power of top-down context guidance, we further propose a novel \textbf{Cont}ext-\textbf{Mix}ing Dynamic Convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases. These properties are absent in previous convolutions. With the support from both DDS and ContMix, our OverLoCK exhibits notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2\%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while only using around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection with Cascade Mask R-CNN, our OverLoCK-S surpasses MogaNet-B by a significant 1\% in AP$^b$.

Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of MAEs remain insufficiently understood. Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the functioning of MAEs through contrastive learning and feature representation analysis, yet these approaches often provide only implicit insights. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for understanding MAEs by leveraging the information bottleneck principle in information theory. Our theoretical analyses reveal that optimizing the latent features to balance relevant and irrelevant information is key to improving MAE performance. Building upon our proofs, we introduce MI-MAE, a novel method that optimizes MAEs through mutual information maximization and minimization. By enhancing latent features to retain maximal relevant information between them and the output, and minimizing irrelevant information between them and the input, our approach achieves better performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that MI-MAE significantly outperforms MAE models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our findings validate the theoretical framework and highlight the practical advantages of applying the information bottleneck principle to MAEs, offering deeper insights for developing more powerful self-supervised learning models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

However, the core component of ViT, Self-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic computational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To alleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on ImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**.

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets.

| **[Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation: A Label Space Unification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19177v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing number of datasets sharing similar domains for semantic segmentation have been published over the past few years. But despite the growing amount of overall data, it is still difficult to train bigger and better models due to inconsistency in taxonomy and/or labeling policies of different datasets. To this end, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that also serves as a label space unification method for semantic segmentation. In short, a teacher model is trained on a source dataset with a given taxonomy, then used to pseudo-label additional data for which ground truth labels of a related label space exist. By mapping the related taxonomies to the source taxonomy, we create constraints within which the model can predict pseudo-labels. Using the improved pseudo-labels we train student models that consistently outperform their teachers in two challenging domains, namely urban and off-road driving. Our ground truth-corrected pseudo-labels span over 12 and 7 public datasets with 388.230 and 18.558 images for the urban and off-road domains, respectively, creating the largest compound datasets for autonomous driving to date.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Potential Field as Scene Affordance for Behavior Change-Based Visual Risk Object Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15846v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study behavior change-based visual risk object identification (Visual-ROI), a critical framework designed to detect potential hazards for intelligent driving systems. Existing methods often show significant limitations in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, stemming from an incomplete understanding of scene affordance. For example, these methods frequently misidentify vehicles that do not impact the ego vehicle as risk objects. Furthermore, existing behavior change-based methods are inefficient because they implement causal inference in the perspective image space. We propose a new framework with a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we utilize potential fields as scene affordance, involving repulsive forces derived from road infrastructure and traffic participants, along with attractive forces sourced from target destinations. In this work, we compute potential fields by assigning different energy levels according to the semantic labels obtained from BEV semantic segmentation. We conduct thorough experiments and ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with various state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show a notable increase in spatial and temporal consistency, with enhancements of 20.3% and 11.6% on the RiskBench dataset, respectively. Additionally, we can improve computational efficiency by 88%. We achieve improvements of 5.4% in spatial accuracy and 7.2% in temporal consistency on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method. The efficacy of our approach indicates the benefits of leveraging commonly-ignored free modalities for FS-PCS, providing valuable insights for future research.

Traditional frame-based methods often struggle to balance latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we leverage event streams from event-based cameras-bio-inspired sensors that trigger events in response to changes in the scene. Specifically, we analyze the number of events triggered between successive frames, with a high number indicating significant changes and a low number indicating minimal changes. We exploit this event information to solve the semantic segmentation task by employing a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a bio-inspired computing paradigm known for its low energy consumption. Our experiments on the DSEC dataset show that our approach significantly reduces latency with only a limited drop in accuracy. Additionally, by using SNNs, we achieve low power consumption, making our method suitable for energy-constrained real-time applications. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to effectively balance reduced latency, minimal accuracy loss, and energy efficiency using events stream to enhance semantic segmentation in dynamic and resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> | None |
| **[Sewer Image Super-Resolution with Depth Priors and Its Lightweight Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19271v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quick-view (QV) technique serves as a primary method for detecting defects within sewerage systems. However, the effectiveness of QV is impeded by the limited visual range of its hardware, resulting in suboptimal image quality for distant portions of the sewer network. Image super-resolution is an effective way to improve image quality and has been applied in a variety of scenes. However, research on super-resolution for sewer images remains considerably unexplored. In response, this study leverages the inherent depth relationships present within QV images and introduces a novel Depth-guided, Reference-based Super-Resolution framework denoted as DSRNet. It comprises two core components: a depth extraction module and a depth information matching module (DMM). DSRNet utilizes the adjacent frames of the low-resolution image as reference images and helps them recover texture information based on the correlation. By combining these modules, the integration of depth priors significantly enhances both visual quality and performance benchmarks. Besides, in pursuit of computational efficiency and compactness, a super-resolution knowledge distillation model based on an attention mechanism is introduced. This mechanism facilitates the acquisition of feature similarity between a more complex teacher model and a streamlined student model, with the latter being a lightweight version of DSRNet. Experimental results demonstrate that DSRNet significantly improves PSNR and SSIM compared with other methods. This study also conducts experiments on sewer defect semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification on the Pipe dataset and Sewer-ML dataset. Experiments show that the method can improve the performance of low-resolution sewer images in these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, 3D medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) remains underexplored due to the lack of a large-scale, publicly available 3D medical image-report dataset. To bridge this gap, we introduce **CT-3DVLP**, the first and largest **public** 3D volume-report dataset, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for 3D MedVLP research. Meanwhile, we propose the **T3D** framework, which enhances 3D MedVLP beyond naive CLIP-style alignment that directly pairs volumes with reports but neglects local visual representations. Instead, we introduce **Text-informed Multi-view Alignment (TMA)**, a novel approach that clusters volumetric data while enforcing consistency across different views of the same volume-report pair. TMA integrates textual features into fine-grained visual representations, ensuring contextual coherence across views. We evaluate T3D across multiple downstream tasks in both unimodal and cross-modal settings, including zero-shot and fine-tuned classification, cross-modal retrieval, report generation, and semantic segmentation. Our results show that T3D consistently outperforms existing vSSL and multimodal methods, demonstrating superior zero-shot and fine-tuning capabilities and setting a new benchmark for 3D medical image understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DICEPTION: A Generalist Diffusion Model for Visual Perceptual Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17157v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our primary goal here is to create a good, generalist perception model that can tackle multiple tasks, within limits on computational resources and training data. To achieve this, we resort to text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images. Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch. When adapting our model to other tasks, it only requires fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and 1% of its parameters. DICEPTION provides valuable insights and a more promising solution for visual generalist models.

While existing frameworks such as Auxiliary Modality Learning (AML) effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they primarily operate in a single-agent context. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic environments, such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. To address these challenges, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning ($\textbf{CAML}$), a novel multi-agent multi-modality framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multimodal data during training while allowing inference with reduced modalities per agent during testing. We systematically analyze the effectiveness of $\textbf{CAML}$ from the perspective of uncertainty reduction and data coverage, providing theoretical insights into its advantages over AML. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that \ours~achieves up to a ${\bf 58.13}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate $\textbf{CAML}$ on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.61}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, minor fix</p></details> | None |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  | None |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

However, due to the needs of specific equipment and special application scenarios, the acquisition and annotation of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often costly and time-consuming. To this end, our work explores the potential of generative diffusion model in synthesizing HSIs with pixel-level annotations. The main idea is to utilize a two-stream VAE to learn the latent representations of images and corresponding masks respectively, learn their joint distribution during the diffusion model training, and finally obtain the image and mask through their respective decoders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to generate high-dimensional HSIs with annotations. Our proposed approach can be applied in various kinds of dataset generation. We select two of the most widely used dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation and change detection, and generate datasets suitable for these tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our synthetic datasets have a positive impact on the improvement of these downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments.

Its real-world adoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained during surgical procedures. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024 from 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in surgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress toward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of organs/tissues in surgical videos. Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused predominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal surgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)] and low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures addressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net [14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger organs such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to smaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated real-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps). Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based semantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability, particularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures, data availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future advancements.</p></details> | 38 pages, 2 figures | None |

The core problem of multi-teacher KD is how to balance distillation strengths among various teachers. Most existing methods often develop weighting strategies from an individual perspective of teacher performance or teacher-student gaps, lacking comprehensive information for guidance. This paper proposes Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning (MTKD-RL) to optimize multi-teacher weights. In this framework, we construct both teacher performance and teacher-student gaps as state information to an agent. The agent outputs the teacher weight and can be updated by the return reward from the student. MTKD-RL reinforces the interaction between the student and teacher using an agent in an RL-based decision mechanism, achieving better matching capability with more meaningful weights. Experimental results on visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrate that MTKD-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing multi-teacher KD works.</p></details> | AAAI-2025 | None |

Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

Accurate identification of flooded areas is crucial for effective disaster management and urban planning. While few works have utilized convolutional neural networks and transformer-based semantic segmentation techniques for identifying flooded areas from aerial footage, recent developments in graph neural networks have created improvement opportunities.

Furthermore, this paper explores the applicability of transfer learning and model reprogramming to enhance the accuracy of flood area segmentation models. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GAC-UNET model, outperforms other approaches with 91\% mAP, 94\% dice score, and 89\% IoU, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and better planning of future infrastructures in flood-prone areas.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the inadequate coupling between class activation responses and semantic information in high-dimensional space, the CAM is prone to object co-occurrence or under-activation, resulting in inferior recognition accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose DOEI, Dual Optimization of Embedding Information, a novel approach that reconstructs embedding representations through semantic-aware attention weight matrices to optimize the expression capability of embedding information. Specifically, DOEI amplifies tokens with high confidence and suppresses those with low confidence during the class-to-patch interaction. This alignment of activation responses with semantic information strengthens the propagation and decoupling of target features, enabling the generated embeddings to more accurately represent target features in high-level semantic space. In addition, we propose a hybrid-feature alignment module in DOEI that combines RGB values, embedding-guided features, and self-attention weights to increase the reliability of candidate tokens. Comprehensive experiments show that DOEI is an effective plug-and-play module that empowers state-of-the-art visual transformer-based WSSS models to significantly improve the quality of CAMs and segmentation performance on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC (+3.6%, +1.5%, +1.2% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.2%, +1.6% mIoU).

| **[Aligning Task- and Reconstruction-Oriented Communications for Edge Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15472v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)</p></details> | None |

The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student (compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class, thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network. Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Confidence-Weighted Boundary-Aware Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15152v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation performance by utilising unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. Existing SSSS methods often face challenges such as coupling, where over-reliance on initial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused by insufficient boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge information. To address these issues, we propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels. Additionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being extensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) remain under-explored in SSSS. Specifically, our approach: (1) reduces coupling through a confidence-weighted loss function that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labels based on their predicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic thresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model performance, (3) resolves boundary blur with a boundary-aware module that enhances segmentation accuracy near object boundaries, and (4) reduces label noise with a confidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during training. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, using only 1/8 or 12.5\% of labeled data, our method achieves a mIoU of 75.81 on Pascal VOC 2012, highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple contrastive heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a modified nearest neighbor objective constructs semantic clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings. The refinement process is short and simple - yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. MIM-Refiner efficiently combines the advantages of MIM and ID objectives and compares favorably against previous state-of-the-art SSL models on a variety of benchmarks such as low-shot classification, long-tailed classification, clustering and semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

We establish a baseline through supervised training and a custom validation dataset, evaluate the cross-domain inference with large-scale indoor datasets, and utilize transfer learning to maximize segmentation performance with minimal new data. The findings indicate that with minimal fine-tuning, pre-trained transformer architectures offer an effective strategy for building component segmentation.

To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI | None |

While techniques based on Voronoi diagrams or pre-fractured patterns are effective for real-time applications, they fail to incorporate collision conditions when determining fractured shapes during runtime. This paper introduces a novel learning-based approach for predicting fractured shapes based on collision dynamics at runtime. Our approach seamlessly integrates realistic brittle fracture animations with rigid body simulations, utilising boundary element method (BEM) brittle fracture simulations to generate training data. To integrate collision scenarios and fractured shapes into a deep learning framework, we introduce generative geometric segmentation, distinct from both instance and semantic segmentation, to represent 3D fragment shapes. We propose an eight-dimensional latent code to address the challenge of optimising multiple discrete fracture pattern targets that share similar continuous collision latent codes. This code will follow a discrete normal distribution corresponding to a specific fracture pattern within our latent impulse representation design. This adaptation enables the prediction of fractured shapes using neural discrete representation learning. Our experimental results show that our approach generates considerably more detailed brittle fractures than existing techniques, while the computational time is typically reduced compared to traditional simulation methods at comparable resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of an article published in the Computer Graphics Forum.

Given expert-labeled segmented images of irradiated and unirradiated pellets, we trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to segment images into defect, grain, and boundary classes. Qualitative microstructural information was calculated from these segmented images to facilitate the comparison of unirradiated and irradiated pellets. We tested modifications to improve the sensitivity of the model, including incorporating meta-data into the model and utilizing uncertainty quantification. The predicted segmentation was similar to the expert-labeled segmentation for most methods of microstructural qualification, including pixel proportion, defect area, and defect density. Overall, the high performance metrics for the best models for both irradiated and unirradiated images shows that utilizing neural network models is a viable alternative to expert-labeled images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing SSC methods often overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models while also reducing deployment costs.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge in medical image segmentation is achieving accurate delineation of regions of interest in the presence of noise, low contrast, or complex anatomical structures. Existing segmentation models often neglect the integration of multi-grained information and fail to preserve edge details, which are critical for precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel image semantic segmentation model called the Multi-Grained Feature Integration Network (MGFI-Net). Our MGFI-Net is designed with two dedicated modules to tackle these issues. First, to enhance segmentation accuracy, we introduce a Multi-Grained Feature Extraction Module, which leverages hierarchical relationships between different feature scales to selectively focus on the most relevant information. Second, to preserve edge details, we incorporate an Edge Enhancement Module that effectively retains and integrates boundary information to refine segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGFI-Net not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy but also achieves superior time efficiency, establishing it as a leading solution for real-time medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

We focus in the cleaning stage on removing outliers from the acquired point cloud data by employing an adaptive threshold technique based on z-score measure. Following the cleaning process, we perform plane detection using the robust RANSAC paradigm. The goal is to carry out multiple plane segmentations, and to classify segments into distinct categories, such as floors, ceilings, and walls. The resulting segments can generate accurate and detailed point clouds representing the building's architectural elements. Moreover, we address the problem of semantic segmentation, which plays a vital role in the identification and classification of different components within the building, such as walls, windows, doors, roofs, and objects. Inspired by the PointNet architecture, we propose a deep learning architecture for efficient semantic segmentation in buildings.

However, the major bottleneck is that these models do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse real-world applications. Therefore, we are in urgent need of a framework that can simultaneously be applicable to both 3D point cloud segmentation and detection, particularly in the circumstances where the labels are rather scarce. This work presents a generalized and straightforward framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. In the limited reconstruction case, our proposed approach, termed WS3D++, ranks 1st on the large-scale ScanNet benchmark on both the task of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation.

This makes the evaluation of semantic segmentation quality in such scenarios an issue to be resolved. However, most of the existing evaluation metrics are developed based on expert-labeled object-level annotations, which are not applicable in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose RS-SQA, an unsupervised quality assessment model for RSI semantic segmentation based on vision language model (VLM). This framework leverages a pre-trained RS VLM for semantic understanding and utilizes intermediate features from segmentation methods to extract implicit information about segmentation quality. Specifically, we introduce CLIP-RS, a large-scale pre-trained VLM trained with purified text to reduce textual noise and capture robust semantic information in the RS domain. Feature visualizations confirm that CLIP-RS can effectively differentiate between various levels of segmentation quality. Semantic features and low-level segmentation features are effectively integrated through a semantic-guided approach to enhance evaluation accuracy. To further support the development of RS semantic segmentation quality assessment, we present RS-SQED, a dedicated dataset sampled from four major RS semantic segmentation datasets and annotated with segmentation accuracy derived from the inference results of 8 representative segmentation methods. Experimental results on the established dataset demonstrate that RS-SQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment models. This provides essential support for predicting segmentation accuracy and high-quality semantic segmentation interpretation, offering substantial practical value.</p></details> | 16 pages,6 figures | None |

However, their application in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For instance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas complex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while most VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The lack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these challenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual grounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic segmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various imaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage training procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open datasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in other common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation.

However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

| **[Efficient Domain Augmentation for Autonomous Driving Testing Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13661v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).

| **[From Open-Vocabulary to Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11891v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to identify novel object categories beyond their training data. While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> | None |
| **[iFormer: Integrating ConvNet and Transformer for Mobile Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15369v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Knowledge Swapping via Learning and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08075v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
