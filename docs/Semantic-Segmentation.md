| **[Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples. Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects, that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the object-level correlation between the support target object and query general objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM) and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SEEC: Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Learned Lossless Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07704v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall, OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level, OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding. Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation, and map-assisted navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO), project website: https://omni-map.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Detect Changes like Humans: Incorporating Semantic Priors for Improved Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16918v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing the appearance (e.g., color, texture) with the help of semantics (e.g., objects, relations). However, mainstream binary change detection models adopt a supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main constraint. Thus, such methods primarily emphasize difference-aware features between bi-temporal images, and the semantic understanding of changed landscapes is undermined, resulting in limited accuracy in the face of noise and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating semantic priors from visual foundation models to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network (SA-CDNet), which transfers the knowledge of visual foundation models (i.e., FastSAM) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we explore a single-temporal pre-training strategy for better adaptation of visual foundation models. With pseudo-change data constructed from single-temporal segmentation datasets, we employ an extra branch of proxy semantic segmentation task for pre-training. We explore various settings like dataset combinations and landscape types, thus providing valuable insights. Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UrbanTwin: High-Fidelity Synthetic Replicas of Roadside Lidar Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06781v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</p></details> |  | None |

Materials and Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition models for Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MR) images, then improved them iteratively and retrained an nnUNet model. Using a random retrospective subset of German National Cohort (NAKO), UK Biobank, internal MR and Computed Tomography (CT) data (Training: 2897 series from 626 subjects, 290 female; mean age 53+-16; 3-fold-cross validation (20% hold-out). Internal testing 36 series from 12 subjects, 6 male; mean age 60+-11), we segmented 71 structures in torso MR and 72 in CT images: 20 organs, 10 muscles, 19 vessels, 16 bones, ribs in CT, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal and body composition (subcutaneous fat, unclassified muscles and visceral fat). For external validation, we used existing automatic organ segmentations, independent ground truth segmentations on gradient echo images, and the Amos data. We used non-parametric bootstrapping for confidence intervals and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for computing statistical significance. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.90+-0.06 on our internal gradient echo test set, which included 71 semantic segmentation labels. Our model ties with the best model on Amos with a Dice of 0,81+-0.14, while having a larger field of view and a considerably higher number structures included. Conclusion: Our work presents a publicly available full-torso segmentation model for MRI and CT images that classifies almost all subject voxels to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/robert-graf/VIBESegmentator</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/robert-graf/VIBESegmentator) |

Existing studies focused on tissue semantic segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances.

| **[BioLite U-Net: Edge-Deployable Semantic Segmentation for In Situ Bioprinting Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06690v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process, labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85% and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame, demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines, BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference-style submission (ICRA 2026).

| **[AARK: An Open Toolkit for Autonomous Racing Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00358v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous racing demands safe control of vehicles at their physical limits for extended periods of time, providing insights into advanced vehicle safety systems which increasingly rely on intervention provided by vehicle autonomy. Participation in this field carries with it a high barrier to entry. Physical platforms and their associated sensor suites require large capital outlays before any demonstrable progress can be made. Simulators allow researches to develop soft autonomous systems without purchasing a platform. However, currently available simulators lack visual and dynamic fidelity, can still be expensive to buy, lack customisation, and are difficult to use. AARK provides three packages, ACI, ACDG, and ACMPC. These packages enable research into autonomous control systems in the demanding environment of racing to bring more people into the field and improve reproducibility: ACI provides researchers with a computer vision-friendly interface to Assetto Corsa for convenient comparison and evaluation of autonomous control solutions; ACDG enables generation of depth, normal and semantic segmentation data for training computer vision models to use in perception systems; and ACMPC gives newcomers to the field a modular full-stack autonomous control solution, capable of controlling vehicles to build from. AARK aims to unify and democratise research into a field critical to providing safer roads and trusted autonomous systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted at the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) 2025.

| **[Leveraging Out-of-Distribution Unlabeled Images: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with an Open-Vocabulary Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03302v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications.

Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data. This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task. This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the authors' failure to reach an agreement on the manuscript quality, they voluntarily waive their rights to be credited as authors</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-modal Uncertainty Robust Tree Cover Segmentation For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04870v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment. Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism, producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Extracting Uncertainty Estimates from Mixtures of Experts for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04816v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models, a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input. Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration.

| **[Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.</p></details> |  | None |

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters.

| **[Differential Morphological Profile Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04268v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Transferable Mask Transformer: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhanced Generative Data Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation via Stronger Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06002v5)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is crucial for pixel-wise annotation tasks like semantic segmentation, where labeling requires significant effort and intensive labor. Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using Class-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Blending to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes.

| **[A Multidimensional AI-powered Framework for Analyzing Tourist Perception in Historic Urban Quarters: A Case Study in Shanghai](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03830v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images. However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2025</p></details> | None |

While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics (2025), Article 1515873.

However, a limitation of current solutions is the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and 33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2025</p></details> | None |

In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest. The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and costly 64-channel LiDAR data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> | None |

| **[TwinLiteNet+: An Enhanced Multi-Task Segmentation Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16958v5)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a fundamental perception task in autonomous driving, particularly for identifying drivable areas and lane markings to enable safe navigation. However, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce TwinLiteNet+, an enhanced multi-task segmentation model designed for real-time drivable area and lane segmentation with high efficiency. TwinLiteNet+ employs a hybrid encoder architecture that integrates stride-based dilated convolutions and depthwise separable dilated convolutions, balancing representational capacity and computational cost. To improve task-specific decoding, we propose two lightweight upsampling modules-Upper Convolution Block (UCB) and Upper Simple Block (USB)-alongside a Partial Class Activation Attention (PCAA) mechanism that enhances segmentation precision. The model is available in four configurations, ranging from the ultra-compact TwinLiteNet+_{Nano} (34K parameters) to the high-performance TwinLiteNet+_{Large} (1.94M parameters). On the BDD100K dataset, TwinLiteNet+_{Large} achieves 92.9% mIoU for drivable area segmentation and 34.2% IoU for lane segmentation-surpassing existing state-of-the-art models while requiring 11x fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) for computation. Extensive evaluations on embedded devices demonstrate superior inference speed, quantization robustness (INT8/FP16), and energy efficiency, validating TwinLiteNet+ as a compelling solution for real-world autonomous driving systems.

| **[Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655v4)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), under review</p></details> | None |

By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Make me an Expert: Distilling from Generalist Black-Box Models into Specialized Models for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00509v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution". Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API predictions.

Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |
| **[Semantic Parsing for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06772v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for question answering over knowledge graphs based on graph-to-segment mapping, designed to improve the understanding of natural language questions. Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce CarboFormer, a lightweight semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates an optimized encoder-decoder architecture with specialized multi-scale feature fusion and auxiliary supervision strategies to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery while achieving competitive accuracy with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboFormer achieves competitive performance with 84.88\% mIoU on CCR and 92.98\% mIoU on RTA, while maintaining computational efficiency with only 5.07M parameters and operating at 84.68 FPS. The model shows particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios and significantly outperforms other lightweight methods like SegFormer-B0 (83.36\% mIoU on CCR) and SegNeXt (82.55\% mIoU on CCR), making it suitable for real-time monitoring on resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones.

Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

Although supervised methods achieve higher accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements. However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability.

This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 33 figures, Submitted to Advanced Engineering Informatics, under revision</p></details> | None |
| **[Integrating SAM Supervision for 3D Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19909v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for 3D semantic segmentation propose training models with limited annotations to address the difficulty of annotating large, irregular, and unordered 3D point cloud data. They usually focus on the 3D domain only, without leveraging the complementary nature of 2D and 3D data. Besides, some methods extend original labels or generate pseudo labels to guide the training, but they often fail to fully use these labels or address the noise within them. Meanwhile, the emergence of comprehensive and adaptable foundation models has offered effective solutions for segmenting 2D data. Leveraging this advancement, we present a novel approach that maximizes the utility of sparsely available 3D annotations by incorporating segmentation masks generated by 2D foundation models. We further propagate the 2D segmentation masks into the 3D space by establishing geometric correspondences between 3D scenes and 2D views. We extend the highly sparse annotations to encompass the areas delineated by 3D masks, thereby substantially augmenting the pool of available labels. Furthermore, we apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency regularization on augmentations of the 3D point cloud and select the reliable pseudo labels, which are further spread on the 3D masks to generate more labels. This innovative strategy bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations and the powerful capabilities of 2D foundation models, ultimately improving the performance of 3D weakly supervised segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications, examining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI technologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition to this qualitative review, we analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras, benchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial resolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature standards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated research potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the defined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In addition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including semantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability, and adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are limited in terms of scale, spectral consistency, the number of spectral channels, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for the development of perception algorithms and the adequate validation of HSI's true potential in ADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in automotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and under review at IEEE OJVT, August 2025</p></details> | None |

However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

| **[IELDG: Suppressing Domain-Specific Noise with Inverse Evolution Layers for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19604v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model using labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust generalization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to improve generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data generated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often contain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training segmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation and error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse evolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using Laplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable generative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced diffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality images. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs can also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation. Based on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and propose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain scenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across scales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module, which performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of multi-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first, a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios.

While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PanoHair: Detailed Hair Strand Synthesis on Volumetric Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18944v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis. Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our experiments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Calibrated Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11491v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and test data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any test sample. Although recent TTA has shown promising performance, we still face two key challenges: 1) prior methods perform backpropagation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable optimization costs to many applications; 2) while existing TTA can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as forgetting). To this end, we have proposed an Efficient Anti-Forgetting Test-Time Adaptation (EATA) method which develops an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples for test-time entropy minimization. To alleviate forgetting, EATA introduces a Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes. However, in EATA, the adopted entropy loss consistently assigns higher confidence to predictions even for samples that are underlying uncertain, leading to overconfident predictions. To tackle this, we further propose EATA with Calibration (EATA-C) to separately exploit the reducible model uncertainty and the inherent data uncertainty for calibrated TTA. Specifically, we measure the model uncertainty by the divergence between predictions from the full network and its sub-networks, on which we propose a divergence loss to encourage consistent predictions instead of overconfident ones. To further recalibrate prediction confidence, we utilize the disagreement among predicted labels as an indicator of the data uncertainty, and then devise a min-max entropy regularizer to selectively increase and decrease prediction confidence for different samples. Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Current state-of-the-art methods leverage traditional computer vision approaches to automate the identification of safe terrain from input digital elevation models (DEMs). However, performance for these methods can degrade for input DEMs with increased sensor noise. In the last decade, deep learning techniques have been developed for various applications. Nevertheless, their applicability to safety-critical space missions has often been limited due to concerns regarding their outputs' reliability. In response to these limitations, this paper proposes an application of the Bayesian deep-learning segmentation method for hazard detection. The developed approach enables reliable, safe landing site detection by: (i) generating simultaneously a safety prediction map and its uncertainty map via Bayesian deep learning and semantic segmentation; and (ii) using the uncertainty map to filter out the uncertain pixels in the prediction map so that the safe site identification is performed only based on the certain pixels (i.e., pixels for which the model is certain about its safety prediction). Experiments are presented with simulated data based on a Mars HiRISE digital terrain model by varying uncertainty threshold and noise levels to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, Accepted by the AIAA Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, revised from Paper AAS 21-253 presented at the AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting in 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[Transferring Styles for Reduced Texture Bias and Improved Robustness in Semantic Segmentation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10239v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

In contrast, coarse annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts. In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target) and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets: Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is small compared to the given dense annotations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation for Remote-Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18067v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes and models will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-2</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-2) |

Internal monitoring system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand, external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle, through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy, highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the proposed perception architecture.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training.

While existing approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's real-world scalability.</p></details> |  | None |

The consequences of incorrectly annotated data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real label error detection in Cityscapes.</p></details> |  | None |

Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction. ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning, with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed model. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware. By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model. This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025, participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear margins.

Despite significant progress in various simulation aspects, such as graphical realism, an evident gap persists between the virtual and real-world environments. Since the ultimate goal is to deploy the autonomous systems in the real world, reducing the sim2real gap is of utmost importance. In this paper, we employ a state-of-the-art approach to enhance the photorealism of simulated data, aligning them with the visual characteristics of real-world datasets. Based on this, we developed CARLA2Real, an easy-to-use, publicly available tool (plug-in) for the widely used and open-source CARLA simulator. This tool enhances the output of CARLA in near real-time, achieving a frame rate of 13 FPS, translating it to the visual style and realism of real-world datasets such as Cityscapes, KITTI, and Mapillary Vistas. By employing the proposed tool, we generated synthetic datasets from both the simulator and the enhancement model outputs, including their corresponding ground truth annotations for tasks related to autonomous driving. Then, we performed a number of experiments to evaluate the impact of the proposed approach on feature extraction and semantic segmentation methods when trained on the enhanced synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the sim2real appearance gap is significant and can indeed be reduced by the introduced approach. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art image-to-image translation approach are also provided.

Most existing methods emphasize inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation. This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module. Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised (pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures.

The central focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality, spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Habil...</summary><p>Habilitation \`a Diriger des Recherches (HDR) manuscript</p></details> | None |
| **[Fine-grained Multi-class Nuclei Segmentation with Molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15751v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Journal of Medical Imaging</p></details> | None |
| **[CM2LoD3: Reconstructing LoD3 Building Models Using Semantic Conflict Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15672v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2 building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution, CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

| **[TripleMixer: A 3D Point Cloud Denoising Model for Adverse Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13802v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog, and rain pose significant challenges to LiDAR-based perception models by introducing noise and corrupting point cloud measurements. To address this issue, we propose TripleMixer, a robust and efficient point cloud denoising network that integrates spatial, frequency, and channel-wise processing through three specialized mixer modules. TripleMixer effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while preserving essential geometric structures and can be seamlessly deployed as a plug-and-play module within existing LiDAR perception pipelines. To support the development and evaluation of denoising methods, we construct two large-scale simulated datasets, Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes, covering diverse weather scenarios with dense point-wise semantic and noise annotations. Based on these datasets, we establish four benchmarks: Denoising, Semantic Segmentation (SS), Place Recognition (PR), and Object Detection (OD). These benchmarks enable systematic evaluation of denoising generalization, transferability, and downstream impact under both simulated and real-world adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TripleMixer achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance and yields substantial improvements across all downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Our results highlight the potential of denoising as a task-agnostic preprocessing strategy to enhance LiDAR robustness in real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, submit to IEEE TIP</p></details> | None |

Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle: (1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset, offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in complex driving environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[A Comprehensive Review of Agricultural Parcel and Boundary Delineation from Remote Sensing Images: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14558v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis, including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1) traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest, decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and tendency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Skin Lesion Segmentation with Transformer-CNN Fusion: Toward Intelligent Skin Cancer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14509v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation tasks in skin lesion analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WeedSense: Multi-Task Learning for Weed Segmentation, Height Estimation, and Growth Stage Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14486v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weed management represents a critical challenge in agriculture, significantly impacting crop yields and requiring substantial resources for control. Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation, and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height measurements, and temporal labels. WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder incorporating Universal Inverted Bottleneck blocks and a Multi-Task Bifurcated Decoder with transformer-based feature fusion to generate multi-scale features and enable simultaneous prediction across multiple tasks. WeedSense outperforms other state-of-the-art models on our comprehensive evaluation. On our multi-task dataset, WeedSense achieves mIoU of 89.78% for segmentation, 1.67cm MAE for height estimation, and 99.99% accuracy for growth stage classification while maintaining real-time inference at 160 FPS. Our multitask approach achieves 3$\times$ faster inference than sequential single-task execution and uses 32.4% fewer parameters.

| **[FOCUS: Frequency-Optimized Conditioning of DiffUSion Models for mitigating catastrophic forgetting during Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14437v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However, balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for dense prediction. FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images. This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands, which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding the LiDAR-to-camera extrinsic parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

| **[Bridging Clear and Adverse Driving Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13592v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation. The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain, snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62 percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for robust AD perception under challenging conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReservoirTTA: Prolonged Test-time Adaptation for Evolving and Recurring Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14511v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Segment Anything in Pathology Images with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20988v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Augmentation Agent for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20439v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Neurocomputing 2025</p></details> | None |

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is a pre-print version of a paper that has been accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality for future publication.

| **[Harnessing Group-Oriented Consistency Constraints for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in CdZnTe Semiconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12766v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT), forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias. To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight, we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module (VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module (VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2 group-annotated data (5\textperthousand).

| **[RMMSS: Towards Advanced Robust Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation with Hybrid Prototype Distillation and Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12861v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in real-world applications due to incomplete, degraded, or missing sensor data. While current MMSS methods typically use self-distillation with modality dropout to improve robustness, they largely overlook inter-modal correlations and thus suffer significant performance degradation when no modalities are missing. To this end, we present RMMSS, a two-stage framework designed to progressively enhance model robustness under missing-modality conditions, while maintaining strong performance in full-modality scenarios. It comprises two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Feature Selection Module (FSM). In the first stage, we pre-train the teacher model with full-modality data and then introduce HPDM to do cross-modal knowledge distillation for obtaining a highly robust model. In the second stage, we freeze both the pre-trained full-modality teacher model and the robust model and propose a trainable FSM that extracts optimal representations from both the feature and logits layers of the models via feature score calculation. This process learns a final student model that maintains strong robustness while achieving high performance under full-modality conditions. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method improves missing-modality performance by 2.80%, 3.89%, and 0.89%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art, while causing almost no drop in full-modality performance (only -0.1% mIoU). Meanwhile, different backbones (AnySeg and CMNeXt) are utilized to validate the generalizability of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5, the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS, which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters. This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised learning for RS applications.

Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</p></details> |  | None |

To be viable for broad deployment across devices with varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements, highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource constraints.

| **[Visual Perception Engine: Fast and Flexible Multi-Head Inference for Robotic Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11584v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution.

This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM). Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25% F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical automotive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICVES, July, 2025</p></details> | None |

Current methods mitigate the domain shift by augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly, Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Unlocking Robust Semantic Segmentation Performance via Label-only Elastic Deformations against Implicit Label Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10383v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Leveraging Motion Estimation for Efficient Bayer-Domain Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15119v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing computer vision processing pipeline acquires visual information using an image sensor that captures pixel information in the Bayer pattern. The raw sensor data are then processed using an image signal processor (ISP) that first converts Bayer pixel data to RGB on a pixel by pixel basis, followed by video convolutional network (VCN) processing on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VCN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that eliminates the ISP and leverages motion estimation to accelerate video vision tasks directly in the Bayer domain. We introduce Motion Estimation-based Video Convolution (MEVC), which integrates sliding-window motion estimation into each convolutional layer, enabling prediction and residual-based refinement that reduces redundant computations across frames. This design bridges the structural gap between block-based motion estimation and spatial convolution, enabling accurate, low-cost processing. Our end-to-end pipeline supports raw Bayer input and achieves over 70\% reduction in FLOPs with minimal accuracy degradation across video semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection benchmarks, using both synthetic Bayer-converted and real Bayer video datasets. This framework generalizes across convolution-based models and marks the first effective reuse of motion estimation for accelerating video computer vision directly from raw sensor data.</p></details> |  | None |

Nesting -- characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance. This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT). In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of 50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822 and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based structural analysis of composite preforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Elsevier Composite Part C: Open Access (JCOMC-D-25-00212), 16 pages, 8 Figures, and 3 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention (GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations, ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10), and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed.

This limits their segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness. Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We propose a unified Hierarchical Vision-Language framework (HVL) that integrates domain-invariant text embeddings as object queries in a transformer-based segmentation network to improve generalization and reduce misclassification under limited supervision. The mentioned textual queries are used for grouping pixels with shared semantics under SSS. HVL is designed to (1) generate textual queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics from VLM while capturing intra-class variations; (2) align these queries with spatial visual features to enhance their segmentation ability and improve the semantic clarity of visual features. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision--language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic understanding. HVL establishes a novel state-of-the-art by achieving a +9.3% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on COCO, utilizing 232 labelled images, +3.1% on Pascal VOC employing 92 labels, +4.8% on ADE20 using 316 labels, and +3.4% on Cityscapes with 100 labels, demonstrating superior performance with less than 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets.

However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points.

However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission | None |

Traditionally, evaluations rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and consistency. We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data (year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year 2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model. Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to 0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to 0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species: F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where earlier models failed. These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BEVANet: Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07300v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet) expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance. Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding 79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

| **[VFM-UDA++: Improving Network Architectures and Data Strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10685v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) enables strong generalization from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, often with limited data. In parallel, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained at scale without labels have also shown impressive downstream performance and generalization. This motivates us to explore how UDA can best leverage VFMs. Prior work (VFM-UDA) demonstrated that replacing a standard ImageNet-pretrained encoder with a VFM improves generalization. However, it also showed that commonly used feature distance losses harm performance when applied to VFMs. Additionally, VFM-UDA does not incorporate multi-scale inductive biases, which are known to improve semantic segmentation. Building on these insights, we propose VFM-UDA++, which (1) investigates the role of multi-scale features, (2) adapts feature distance loss to be compatible with ViT-based VFMs and (3) evaluates how UDA benefits from increased synthetic source and real target data. By addressing these questions, we can improve performance on the standard GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes benchmark by +1.4 mIoU. While prior non-VFM UDA methods did not scale with more data, VFM-UDA++ shows consistent improvement and achieves a further +2.4 mIoU gain when scaling the data, demonstrating that VFM-based UDA continues to benefit from increased data availability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S2-UniSeg: Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling for Scalable Segment Anything without Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06995v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation. However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences. Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four benchmarks.

While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet.

While unsupervised CIS (UCIS) models aim to reduce the heavy reliance on labor-intensive image annotations, they fail to accurately capture cell boundaries, causing missed detections and poor performance. Recognizing the absence of error-free instances as a key limitation, we present COIN (COnfidence score-guided INstance distillation), a novel annotation-free framework with three key steps: (1) Increasing the sensitivity for the presence of error-free instances via unsupervised semantic segmentation with optimal transport, leveraging its ability to discriminate spatially minor instances, (2) Instance-level confidence scoring to measure the consistency between model prediction and refined mask and identify highly confident instances, offering an alternative to ground truth annotations, and (3) Progressive expansion of confidence with recursive self-distillation. Extensive experiments across six datasets show COIN outperforming existing UCIS methods, even surpassing semi- and weakly-supervised approaches across all metrics on the MoNuSeg and TNBC datasets.

| **[Soft Dice Confidence: A Near-Optimal Confidence Estimator for Selective Prediction in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10665v4)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semantic segmentation, even state-of-the-art deep learning models fall short of the performance required in certain high-stakes applications such as medical image analysis. In these cases, performance can be improved by allowing a model to abstain from making predictions when confidence is low, an approach known as selective prediction. While well-known in the classification literature, selective prediction has been underexplored in the context of semantic segmentation. This paper tackles the problem by focusing on image-level abstention, which involves producing a single confidence estimate for the entire image, in contrast to previous approaches that focus on pixel-level uncertainty. Assuming the Dice coefficient as the evaluation metric for segmentation, two main contributions are provided in this paper: (i) In the case of known marginal posterior probabilities, we derive the optimal confidence estimator, which is observed to be intractable for typical image sizes. Then, an approximation computable in linear time, named Soft Dice Confidence (SDC), is proposed and proven to be tightly bounded to the optimal estimator. (ii) When only an estimate of the marginal posterior probabilities are known, we propose a plug-in version of the SDC and show it outperforms all previous methods, including those requiring additional tuning data. These findings are supported by experimental results on both synthetic data and real-world data from six medical imaging tasks, including out-of-distribution scenarios, positioning the SDC as a reliable and efficient tool for selective prediction in semantic segmentation.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures | None |

Control can rely on low-dimensional states estimated from high-dimensional data. However, the estimation errors often follow complex, unknown distributions that standard probabilistic models fail to capture, making formal safety guarantees challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel characterization of these general estimation errors using sub-Gaussian noise with bounded mean. We develop a new technique for uncertainty propagation of proposed noise characterization in linear systems, which combines robust set-based methods with the propagation of sub-Gaussian variance proxies. We further develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that provides closed-loop safety guarantees for linear systems under the proposed noise assumption. We apply this MPC approach in an ultrasound-image-guided robotic spinal surgery pipeline, which contains deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, image-based registration, high-level optimization-based planning, and low-level robotic control. To validate the pipeline, we developed a realistic simulation environment integrating real human anatomy, robot dynamics, efficient ultrasound simulation, as well as in-vivo data of breathing motion and drilling force. Evaluation results in simulation demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving complex image-guided robotic surgery task while ensuring safety.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TEFormer: Texture-Aware and Edge-Guided Transformer for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06224v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification. Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer (TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module (EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic segmentation.</p></details> | Submitted to GRSL | None |
| **[A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06191v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional modular approaches, while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view (BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation, providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning 3D Texture-Aware Representations for Parsing Diverse Human Clothing and Body Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06032v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model -- obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts, clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in prompt-based segmentation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, event data is inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently, pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However, they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency -- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting, which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, while maintaining low latency.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |
| **[Decoupling Continual Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05065v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts.

However, current methods often incorporate specialized feature fusion modules tailored to specific modalities, thereby restricting input flexibility and increasing the number of training parameters. To address these challenges, we propose StitchFusion, a straightforward yet effective modal fusion framework that integrates large-scale pre-trained models directly as encoders and feature fusers. This approach facilitates comprehensive multi-modal and multi-scale feature fusion, accommodating any visual modal inputs. Specifically, Our framework achieves modal integration during encoding by sharing multi-modal visual information. To enhance information exchange across modalities, we introduce a multi-directional adapter module (MultiAdapter) to enable cross-modal information transfer during encoding. By leveraging MultiAdapter to propagate multi-scale information across pre-trained encoders during the encoding process, StitchFusion achieves multi-modal visual information integration during encoding. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four multi-modal segmentation datasets with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, the experimental integration of MultiAdapter with existing Feature Fusion Modules (FFMs) highlights their complementary nature.

However, existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data. By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg) method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g., Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene), HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2, significantly outperforming alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> | None |

Utility Control for AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation, using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of tasks without requiring a lot of changes.</p></details> |  | None |

In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy, however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation therapy to treat AF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the MICCAI Challenge on Comprehensive Analysis and Computing of Real-World Medical Images 2024, 12 pages</p></details> | None |

Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g. electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains. Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be generated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the MICCAI Challenge on Comprehensive Analysis and Computing of Real-World Medical Images 2024, 12 pages</p></details> | None |

However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Revisiting Continual Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04267v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes, remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Previous methods in semantic segmentation have centered on individual pixels or small areas, neglecting the rich patterns in natural images and the power of advanced pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce Entity-Superpixel Annotation (ESA), an innovative and efficient active learning strategy which utilizes a class-agnostic mask proposal network coupled with super-pixel grouping to capture local structural cues. Additionally, our method selects a subset of entities within each image of the target domain, prioritizing superpixels with high entropy to ensure comprehensive representation. Simultaneously, it focuses on a limited number of key entities, thereby optimizing for efficiency. By utilizing an annotator-friendly design that capitalizes on the inherent structure of images, our approach significantly outperforms existing pixel-based methods, achieving superior results with minimal queries, specifically reducing click cost by 98% and enhancing performance by 1.71%. For instance, our technique requires a mere 40 clicks for annotation, a stark contrast to the 5000 clicks demanded by conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models' ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information, thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables; The code is available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/TCSAFormer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiaZunhui/TCSAFormer) |

However, this task is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations and a neglect of target structural information. Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network (PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first, structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information. Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is designed to explicitly attend to the most relevant content. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MedFormer outperforms existing medical vision transformers in terms of generality and efficiency. Extensive experiments across various imaging modality datasets show that MedFormer consistently enhances performance in all three medical image recognition tasks mentioned above. MedFormer provides an efficient and versatile solution for medical image recognition, with strong potential for clinical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables; The code is available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer) |

Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy, ensuring robust learning throughout the training process.

Existing methods typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization, which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal complementarity for true harmony in diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning, while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability. Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic segmentation task of domain generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

While pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics. Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods.

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

LemonFM consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models across four downstream tasks and six datasets, achieving significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+9.5pp, +9.4pp, and +8.4pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), surgical action recognition (+4.4pp of mAP in CholecT50), surgical tool presence detection (+5.3pp and +10.2pp of mAP in Cholec80 and GraSP), and surgical semantic segmentation (+8.3pp of mDice in CholecSeg8k). LEMON and LemonFM will serve as foundational resources for the research community and industry, accelerating progress in developing autonomous robotic surgery systems and ultimately contributing to safer and more accessible surgical care worldwide.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title updated (now: LEMON, before: Surg-3M)</p></details> | None |
| **[SpectralX: Parameter-efficient Domain Generalization for Spectral Remote Sensing Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01731v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions. Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA) that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website: https://github.com/YuxiangZhang-BIT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dynamic Robot-Assisted Surgery with Hierarchical Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01713v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rein++: Efficient Generalization and Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01667v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios. Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable, instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g., daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g., nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of parameters.

| **[Adverse Weather-Independent Framework Towards Autonomous Driving Perception through Temporal Correlation and Unfolded Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01583v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition. Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.14737</p></details> | None |
| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks.

However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem.

While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods.

While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks.

However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities.

Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network.

Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Likelihood Ratio Estimation for Pixel-Wise Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00587v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead.

Multimodality enables the integration of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T) imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673 ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability.

| **[Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Modeling for Remote Sensing Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN) |

Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</p></details> |  | None |

However, the reliability of evaluation depends on the diversity and realism of the generated scenes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly extreme rainfalls, are rare and costly to capture in real-world settings. While simulated environments can help address this limitation, existing rainy image synthesizers often suffer from poor controllability over illumination and limited realism, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the model evaluation. To that end, we propose a learning-from-rendering rainy image synthesizer, which combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the controllability of learning-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of our extreme rainy image synthesizer on semantic segmentation task, we require a continuous set of well-labeled extreme rainy images. By integrating the proposed synthesizer with the CARLA driving simulator, we develop CARLARain an extreme rainy street scene simulator which can obtain paired rainy-clean images and labels under complex illumination conditions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that CARLARain can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models in extreme rainy scenes, with the models' accuracy (mIoU) improved by 5% - 8% on the synthetic dataset and significantly enhanced in real extreme rainy scenarios under complex illuminations.

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent.

The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which could extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available.

Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |

| **[Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19386v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses. These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis (NVS).

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01788, arXiv:2304.01168 by other authors</p></details> | None |
| **[TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks, as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Building upon the state-space style alignment framework introduced by \emph{StyleMamba}, our method integrates a semantic segmentation model into the style transfer pipeline. This allows users to selectively apply text-driven style changes to specific segments (e.g., ``turn the building into a cyberpunk tower'') while leaving other regions (e.g., ``people'' or ``trees'') unchanged. By incorporating region-wise condition vectors and a region-specific directional loss, our method achieves high-fidelity transformations that respect both semantic boundaries and user-driven style descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can flexibly handle complex scene stylizations in real-world scenarios, improving control and quality over purely global style transfer methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> | None |
| **[Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these advantages, the task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense, semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module (MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Cross-architecture Consistency Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21959v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys. Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve pseudo mask quality.</p></details> |  | None |

For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML'25 | None |

In this study, we show that a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions, outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative medicine and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Conference on Machine Vision Applications MVA2025</p></details> | None |

Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting less influential branches. Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels. Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.</p></details> |  | None |

Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Probabilistic Modeling Beyond Domain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21367v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and challenging urban scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

Understanding the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved.

Nevertheless, high-quality and large-scale underwater datasets with dense annotations remain scarce because of the complex environment and the exorbitant data collection costs. This paper proposes a unified Text-to-Image and DEnse annotation generation method (TIDE) for underwater scenes. It relies solely on text as input to simultaneously generate realistic underwater images and multiple highly consistent dense annotations. Specifically, we unify the generation of text-to-image and text-to-dense annotations within a single model. The Implicit Layout Sharing mechanism (ILS) and cross-modal interaction method called Time Adaptive Normalization (TAN) are introduced to jointly optimize the consistency between image and dense annotations. We synthesize a large-scale underwater dataset using TIDE to validate the effectiveness of our method in underwater dense prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of existing underwater dense prediction models and mitigates the scarcity of underwater data with dense annotations.

These attacks, involving hidden triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate (ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CoLLAs 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[SeeDiff: Off-the-Shelf Seeded Mask Generation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19808v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS) separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Occlusion in FER: A Semantic-Aware Perspective and Go Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15401v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features, leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases. Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes, further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions, dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

| **[HybridTM: Combining Transformer and Mamba for 3D Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18575v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets. Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at https://github.com/deepinact/HybridTM.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/deepinact/HybridTM) |
| **[Iwin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Interleaved Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18405v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/cominder/Iwin-Transformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/cominder/Iwin-Transformer) |
| **[GVCCS: A Dataset for Contrail Identification and Tracking on Visible Whole Sky Camera Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18330v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Multi-Dataset Benchmark for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in ECG Delineation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18323v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |
