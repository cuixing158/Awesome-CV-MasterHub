| **[Beyond One Shot, Beyond One Perspective: Cross-View and Long-Horizon Distillation for Better LiDAR Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05260v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning; and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code has be made publicly accessible for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; 26 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables; Code at http://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMA</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMA) |
| **[SwiftSeg: Efficient Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion). Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty in Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on Embedded Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01201v5)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application for semantic segmentation models in areas such as autonomous vehicles and human computer interaction require real-time predictive capabilities. The challenges of addressing real-time application is amplified by the need to operate on resource constrained hardware. Whilst development of real-time methods for these platforms has increased, these models are unable to sufficiently reason about uncertainty present when applied on embedded real-time systems. This paper addresses this by combining deep feature extraction from pre-trained models with Bayesian regression and moment propagation for uncertainty aware predictions. We demonstrate how the proposed method can yield meaningful epistemic uncertainty on embedded hardware in real-time whilst maintaining predictive performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOSU: Autonomous Long-range Robot Navigation with Multi-modal Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04686v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MOSU, a novel autonomous long-range navigation system that enhances global navigation for mobile robots through multimodal perception and on-road scene understanding. MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments. This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global navigation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Street design and driving behavior: evidence from a large-scale study in Milan, Amsterdam, and Dubai](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04434v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners, supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Free-Mask: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01819v4)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM(2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[CLIP-RL: Surgical Scene Segmentation Using Contrastive Language-Vision Pretraining & Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04317v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions, texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges. CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018 and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Surg-SegFormer: A Dual Transformer-Based Model for Holistic Surgical Scene Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04304v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools, and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures. However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts, rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently and effectively understand complex surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Case 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Particle Trajectory Representation Learning with Masked Point Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02558v3)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been key to unlocking large datasets for representation learning. While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains a challenge. Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for fundamental physics, but analysis of their sparse, complex point cloud data often relies on supervised methods trained on large simulations, introducing potential biases. We introduce the Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE), applying masked point modeling to unlabeled LArTPC images using domain-specific volumetric tokenization and energy prediction. We show this SSL approach learns physically meaningful trajectory representations directly from data. This yields remarkable data efficiency: fine-tuning on just 100 labeled events achieves track/shower semantic segmentation performance comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised baseline trained on $>$100,000 events. Furthermore, internal attention maps exhibit emergent instance segmentation of particle trajectories. While challenges remain, particularly for fine-grained features, we make concrete SSL's potential for building a foundation model for LArTPC image analysis capable of serving as a common base for all data reconstruction tasks. To facilitate further progress, we release PILArNet-M, a large dataset of 1M LArTPC events.

| **[Differentiable High-Performance Ray Tracing-Based Simulation of Radio Propagation with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04021v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models augmented with semantic segmentation labels. In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NRSeg: Noise-Resilient Learning for BEV Semantic Segmentation via Driving World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04002v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively.

| **[CoT-Segmenter: Enhancing OOD Detection in Dense Road Scenes via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03984v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle: (1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset, offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in complex driving environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Efficient Event-Based Semantic Segmentation via Exploiting Frame-Event Fusion: A Hybrid Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03765v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation, owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties. However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches: the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS) Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features, enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment. The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption, achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To delve into this problem, we construct a UPLight RGB-P segmentation benchmark with 12 typical underwater semantic classes. In this work, we design the ShareCMP, an RGB-P semantic segmentation framework with a shared dual-branch architecture (ShareCMP Encoder), which reduces the parameters and memory space by about 33.8\% compared to previous dual-branch models. It encompasses a Polarization Generate Attention (PGA) module designed to generate polarization modal images with richer polarization properties for the encoder. In addition, we introduce the Class Polarization-Aware Loss (CPALoss) with Class Polarization-Aware Auxiliary Head (CPAAHead) to improve the learning and understanding of the encoder for polarization modal information and to optimize the PGA module. With extensive experiments on a total of three RGB-P benchmarks, our ShareCMP achieves the best performance in mIoU with fewer parameters on the UPLight (92.45{\small (+0.32)}\%), ZJU (92.7{\small (+0.1)}\%), and MCubeS (50.99{\small (+1.51)}\%) datasets. And our ShareCMP (w/o PGA) achieves competitive or even higher performance on other RGB-X datasets compared to the corresponding state-of-the-art RGB-X methods.

| **[Leveraging Out-of-Distribution Unlabeled Images: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with an Open-Vocabulary Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03302v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications.

Recent developments have achieved this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information. However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics (segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC), trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining. Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.

| **[From Pixels to Damage Severity: Estimating Earthquake Impacts Using Semantic Segmentation of Social Media Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02781v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, recent methods often overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow).

Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks.

| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Addressing these two tasks with separate networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in mIoU by over 9%. Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/TiCoSS upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Operating Room Workflow Analysis using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12552v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection. Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00420v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

| **[FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16025v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones is Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at $224 \times 224$px, while the "high-resolution" versions are around $378-448$px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-resolution vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model training using RADIO as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

| **[How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |
| **[Average Calibration Error: A Differentiable Loss for Improved Reliability in Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06759v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

| **[ExPaMoE: An Expandable Parallel Mixture of Experts for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00502v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts. However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address this limitation, we propose ExPaMoE, a novel framework based on an Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts architecture. ExPaMoE decouples domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool based on a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD) that detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce ImageNet++, a large-scale and realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Gift from the Integration of Discriminative and Diffusion-based Generative Learning: Boundary Refinement Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01573v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at https://github.com/KeyanHu-git/IDGBR.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/KeyanHu-git/IDGBR) |
| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations.

| **[Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/qhfan/MALA) |

However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 3rd Word Congress on Artificial Intelligence in Materials & Manufacturing 2025</p></details> | None |

Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing studies have paid insufficient attention to the intrinsic spatial properties of depth maps. This oversight significantly impacts the attention representation, leading to prediction errors caused by attention shift issues. To this end, we propose a novel learnable Depth interaction Pyramid Transformer (DiPFormer) to explore the effectiveness of depth. Firstly, we introduce Depth Spatial-Aware Optimization (Depth SAO) as offset to represent real-world spatial relationships. Secondly, the similarity in the feature space of RGB-D is learned by Depth Linear Cross-Attention (Depth LCA) to clarify spatial differences at the pixel level. Finally, an MLP Decoder is utilized to effectively fuse multi-scale features for meeting real-time requirements. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DiPFormer significantly addresses the issue of attention misalignment in both road detection (+7.5%) and semantic segmentation (+4.9% / +1.5%) tasks. DiPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI (97.57% F-score on KITTI road and 68.74% mIoU on KITTI-360) and Cityscapes (83.4% mIoU) datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

Outdoor robots are particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system. In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy environments and volcanic terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> | None |

The key ingredient is a confidence score function, which should be directly related to the conditional risk. In the case of binary semantic segmentation, existing score functions either ignore the particularities of the evaluation metric or demand additional held-out data for tuning. We propose the Soft Dice Confidence (SDC), a simple, tuning-free confidence score function that directly aligns with the Dice coefficient metric. We prove that, under conditional independence, the SDC is near optimal: we establish upper and lower bounds on the ratio between the SDC and the ideal (intractable) confidence score function and show that these bounds are very close to 1. Experiments on six public medical-imaging benchmarks and on synthetic data corroborate our theoretical findings. In fact, SDC outperformed all prior confidence estimators from the literature in all of our experiments, including those that rely on additional data. These results position SDC as a reliable and efficient confidence estimator for selective prediction in semantic segmentation.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures | None |

While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AWF: Adaptive Weight Fusion for Enhanced Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08516v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a balance between previously learned and newly introduced knowledge. Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures | None |

Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements. Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution, enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such approaches treat multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint, offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FastSeg: Efficient Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion). Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40 neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as the StarVIBE series.

In the absence of precise point-level labels, current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module, our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning. To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics, which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions. Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our approach's individual components.

Recently, pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning. However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic, limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples, particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS and class-incremental setting.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP), which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally, pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.</p></details> |  | None |

This study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size, thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance, compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications, offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality performance in agricultural imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[Split Matching for Inductive Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05023v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Beyond adaptation-based methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses. Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in hIoU.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted for publication in lEEE/RSJ international Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (lROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed (FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation.

This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance.

The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency.

When detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to 0.565.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects. First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.

| **[TSDASeg: A Two-Stage Model with Direct Alignment for Interactive Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20991v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation, classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures | None |

Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets.

This makes frequent assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures. Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points. Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques, achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For a fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validation to minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the five best architectures based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, is integrated into a custom telehealth system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 18 pages; supplementary material: 15 pages; the paper has been accepted for publication at the Applied Data Science (ADS) track of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD 2025)</p></details> | None |

While most efforts in the geospatial domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions, sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Remote Sensing Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12280v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across any set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse STS configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Code link:https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_TSSUN) |

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment. By leveraging multi-frame semantic associations, this strategy enables joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, resulting in low-drift tracking and accurate semantic mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.</p></details> | IROS 2025 | None |

However, existing methods face challenges in computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features, selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  | None |

AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1) Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3) Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction, totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.</p></details> |  | None |

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations.

Despite advancements, current models often struggle with segmenting densely packed elements due to a lack of comprehensive fusion features for guidance during training. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) allows precise control during fine-tuning through its flexible prompting encoder, its potential remains largely unexplored in the context of multimodal segmentation for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules. This approach transforms the training methodology for multimodal segmentation from a traditional black-box approach to a controllable, prompt-based mechanism. Specifically, we obtain latent space features for both modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We then use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 4.1$\%$ over the state-of-the-art method in segmentation mIoU, and the performance is also optimized in other multi-modal visual scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge, dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82% GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets. Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel combinations perform better than single-scale configurations.

To resolve this critical limitation, we introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal 2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost.

However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50.

In smart manufacturing, a representative EI scenario is robotic visual inspection, where industrial robots must accurately inspect components on rapidly changing, heterogeneous production lines.

LAECIPS decouples large vision models in the cloud from lightweight models on the edge, enabling plug-and-play model adaptation and continual learning. Through a hard input mining-based inference strategy, LAECIPS routes complex and uncertain inspection cases to the cloud while handling routine tasks at the edge, achieving both high accuracy and low latency. Experiments conducted on a real-world robotic semantic segmentation system for visual inspection demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, processing latency, and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.</p></details> | Submitted to TMLR | None |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities. To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task. Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Polyline Path Masked Attention for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15940v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which could extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 29 references</p></details> | None |

Addressing the core challenge of autonomous UAV landing in complex and unknown environments, this study innovatively leverages the depth-normal synergy prediction capabilities of the Metric3D V2 model to construct an end-to-end safe landing zones (SLZ) estimation framework. By introducing a safe zone segmentation branch, we transform the landing zone estimation task into a binary semantic segmentation problem. The model is fine-tuned and annotated using the WildUAV dataset from a UAV perspective, while a cross-domain evaluation dataset is constructed to validate the model's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that VisLanding significantly enhances the accuracy of safe zone identification through a depth-normal joint optimization mechanism, while retaining the zero-shot generalization advantages of Metric3D V2. The proposed method exhibits superior generalization and robustness in cross-domain testing compared to other approaches. Furthermore, it enables the estimation of landing zone area by integrating predicted depth and normal information, providing critical decision-making support for practical applications.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 | None |
| **[DepthSeg: Depth prompting in remote sensing semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14382v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing semantic segmentation is crucial for extracting detailed land surface information, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring, land use planning, and resource assessment. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks. Detailed ablation studies further highlight the significance of the depth prompts in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization. Vision-Language Models offer robust, domain-invariant semantics but lack the spatial grounding required for dense prediction. We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation closes the label efficiency gap and unlocks new levels of fine-grained, instance-aware generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

In this survey, we present a holistic review of recent advances in VSP, covering a wide array of vision tasks, including Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS), Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), as well as Video Tracking and Segmentation (VTS), and Open-Vocabulary Video Segmentation (OVVS). We systematically analyze the evolution from traditional hand-crafted features to modern deep learning paradigms -- spanning from fully convolutional networks to the latest transformer-based architectures -- and assess their effectiveness in capturing both local and global temporal contexts. Furthermore, our review critically discusses the technical challenges, ranging from maintaining temporal consistency to handling complex scene dynamics, and offers a comprehensive comparative study of datasets and evaluation metrics that have shaped current benchmarking standards. By distilling the key contributions and shortcomings of state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey highlights emerging trends and prospective research directions that promise to further elevate the robustness and adaptability of VSP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.</p></details> | TMLR camera-ready | None |

However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc) |

Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks.

Generally, existing semantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking parameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational requirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to the professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling, obtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and professional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively developed an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model, we can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained improvement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we decouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal using of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA mechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of coal microscopic images. This DCSA can decompose the large kernels of convolutional attention into multiple scales and reduce 81.18% of parameters.Finally, we performed the contrast experiment and ablation experiment between DA-VIT and state-of-the-art methods at lots of evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that DA-VIT-Base achieves 92.14% pixel accuracy and 63.18% mIoU. Params and FLOPs of DA-VIT-Tiny are 4.95M and 8.99G, respectively.

However, in this work, we show that the existing FSS methods often struggle to generalize to underwater environments. Specifically, the prior features extracted by pre-trained models used as feature extractors are fragile due to the unique challenges of underwater images. To address this, we propose FSSUWNet, a tailored FSS framework for underwater images with feature enhancement. FSSUWNet exploits the integration of complementary features, emphasizing both low-level and high-level image characteristics. In addition to employing a pre-trained model as the primary encoder, we propose an auxiliary encoder called Feature Enhanced Encoder which extracts complementary features to better adapt to underwater scene characteristics. Furthermore, a simple and effective Feature Alignment Module aims to provide global prior knowledge and align low-level features with high-level features in dimensions. Given the scarcity of underwater images, we introduce a cross-validation dataset version based on the Segmentation of Underwater Imagery dataset. Extensive experiments on public underwater segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, our method outperforms the previous best method by 2.8% and 2.6% in terms of the mean Intersection over Union metric for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios in the datasets, respectively.

The key challenge here is the discrepancy between the target of dense per-point semantic prediction and training losses derived from only scene-level labels. To address this, in addition to the typical weakly-supervised setup that supervises all points with the scene label, we propose to conservatively propagate the scene-level labels to points selectively. Specifically, we over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering in the entire dataset and form primitives. We then associate scene-level labels with primitives through bipartite matching. Then, we allow labels to pass through this primitive-label relationship, while further encouraging features to form narrow clusters around the primitives.

In recent years, there has been a concerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for efficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic segmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a variety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains challenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper introduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the boundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework incorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model and a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a new class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model, aiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its surrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real underwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a realistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with real underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater inspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant potential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing valuable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting targeted preservation efforts</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain. In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review. 22 pages, 8 figures</p></details> | None |

While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels.

Central to these developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks, supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a standardized training protocol.

This is a fundamental basis of immersive communication. The ultimate goal is to separate sound event signals with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) information into dry sound object signals and metadata about the object type (sound event class) and representing spatial information, including direction. However, because several existing challenge tasks already provide some of the subset functions, this task for this year focuses on detecting and separating sound events from multi-channel spatial input signals. This paper outlines the S5 task setting of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025 Challenge Task 4 and the DCASE2025 Task 4 Dataset, newly recorded and curated for this task. We also report experimental results for an S5 system trained and evaluated on this dataset.

This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> | None |

Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation. Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation, avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality, multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes, and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference, only a subset of them can be used as input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2025), 15 pages</p></details> | None |

Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |

KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and part and semantic segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We also study a hybrid PointNet model incorporating both KAN and MLP layers. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  | None |

OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method.

However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion, misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First, $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering 1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark for historical urban understanding. Second, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

However, acquiring high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation. Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of 78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points.

Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks.

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</p></details> |  | None |

However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods usually formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the absence of human labels during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively.

Our pipeline extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95% category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances individual style with emerging trends.

However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr) |

Aiming at its further realization, the DCASE 2025 Challenge has recently introduced a task for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5), which focuses on detecting and separating sound events in spatial sound scenes. In this paper, we explore methods for addressing the S5 task. Specifically, we present baseline S5 systems that combine audio tagging (AT) and label-queried source separation (LSS) models. We investigate two LSS approaches based on the ResUNet architecture: a) extracting a single source for each detected event and b) querying multiple sources concurrently. Since each separated source in S5 is identified by its sound event class label, we propose new class-aware metrics to evaluate both the sound sources and labels simultaneously. Experimental results on first-order ambisonics spatial audio demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems and confirm the efficacy of the metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05369v7)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dilated convolution, which expands the receptive field by inserting gaps between its consecutive elements, is widely employed in computer vision. In this study, we propose three strategies to improve individual phases of dilated convolution from the view of spectrum analysis. Departing from the conventional practice of fixing a global dilation rate as a hyperparameter, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC), which dynamically adjusts dilation rates spatially based on local frequency components. Subsequently, we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components, dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights, AdaKern captures more high-frequency components, thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation, thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope. Extensive experiments on segmentation and object detection consistently validate the efficacy of our approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 highlighted</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC) |

There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler. Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information. Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN), which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight | None |
| **[Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07364v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

This task is challenging because target objects in the support and query images can be largely different in appearance and pose (i.e., intra-class variation). Prior works suggested that incorporating more annotated support images in few-shot settings boosts performances but increases costs due to additional manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for ONE-shot semantic segmentation, called Group-On, which packs multiple query images in batches for the benefit of mutual knowledge support within the same category. Specifically, after coarse segmentation masks of the batch of queries are predicted, query-mask pairs act as pseudo support data to enhance mask predictions mutually. To effectively steer such process, we construct an innovative MoME module, where a flexible number of mask experts are guided by a scene-driven router and work together to make comprehensive decisions, fully promoting mutual benefits of queries. Comprehensive experiments on three standard benchmarks show that, in the ONE-shot setting, Group-On significantly outperforms previous works by considerable margins. With only one annotated support image, Group-On can be even competitive with the counterparts using 5 annotated images.</p></details> |  | None |

The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through simulation experiments that our method yields comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and similar reconstruction error to state-of-the-art approaches, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (at least 0.8dB higher PSNR and more than 16% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than maps constructed by a state-of-the-art method, enabling semantic segmentation using off-the-shelf open-set models.

While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> | None |

Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering, facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate sparse label supervision.

While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones.

This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[You Only Train Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO), indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters, which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

Existing methods fuse features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching (MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) excel in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, their application to instance segmentation for autonomous driving remains underexplored and often relies on suboptimal baselines. We introduce UDA4Inst, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through Semantic Category Training and Bidirectional Mixing Training. Semantic Category Training groups semantically related classes for separate training, improving pseudo-label quality and segmentation accuracy. Bidirectional Mixing Training combines instance-wise and patch-wise data mixing, creating coherent composites that enhance generalization across domains. Extensive experiments show UDA4Inst sets a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA-> Cityscapes benchmark (mAP 31.3) and introduces results on novel datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as sources and Cityscapes and KITTI360 as targets.

Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

With the emergence of vision foundation models (VFM) serving as generalist feature extractors, we seek to explore the adaptation of these models for FSS. While current FSS benchmarks focus on adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with few images, they emphasize in-domain generalization, making them less suitable for VFM trained on large-scale web datasets. To address this, we propose a novel realistic benchmark with a simple and straightforward adaptation process tailored for this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent VFM and semantic segmentation models. To evaluate their effectiveness, we leverage various adaption methods, ranging from linear probing to parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Our findings show that models designed for segmentation can be outperformed by self-supervised (SSL) models. On the other hand, while PEFT methods yields competitive performance, they provide little discrepancy in the obtained results compared to other methods, highlighting the critical role of the feature extractor in determining results. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the adaptation of VFM for FSS.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects. Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2 maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods.

While existing vision transformers demonstrate promising performance, they often utilize high-resolution context modeling, resulting in a computational bottleneck. In this work, we challenge conventional wisdom and introduce the Low-Resolution Self-Attention (LRSA) mechanism to capture global context at a significantly reduced computational cost, i.e., FLOPs. Our approach involves computing self-attention in a fixed low-resolution space regardless of the input image's resolution, with additional 3x3 depth-wise convolutions to capture fine details in the high-resolution space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LRSA approach by building the LRFormer, a vision transformer with an encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on the ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that LRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Recent methods addressing this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC) framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r) |

However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve competitive results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications.

Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

In contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability. Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, such SSL approaches often concentrate on employing consistency learning only for individual LiDAR representations. This narrow focus results in limited perturbations that generally fail to enable effective consistency learning. Additionally, these SSL approaches employ contrastive learning based on the sampling from a limited set of positive and negative embedding samples. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework called ItTakesTwo (IT2). IT2 is designed to ensure consistent predictions from peer LiDAR representations, thereby improving the perturbation effectiveness in consistency learning. Furthermore, our contrastive learning employs informative samples drawn from a distribution of positive and negative embeddings learned from the entire training set.

Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

The graph-based method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand, BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> | None |

Before robot manipulators can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense, marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified, scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction and $3 \times$ inference speedup.

| **[Revisiting Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation: A Disentanglement Approach for RGBD Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24361v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal RGB and Depth (RGBD) data are predominant in many domains such as robotics, autonomous driving and remote sensing. The combination of these multi-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial context, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data can be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor modalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures or resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities available during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically based on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills knowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face challenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection, thus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues, we introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on Knowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework for RGBD semantic segmentation. Our approach simultaneously learns single-modality RGB and Depth models by exploiting disentanglement representation, contrastive learning and decoupled data augmentation with the aim to structure the internal manifolds of neural network models through interaction and collaboration. We evaluated CroDiNo-KD on three RGBD datasets across diverse domains, considering recent CMKD frameworks as competitors. Our findings illustrate the quality of CroDiNo-KD, and they suggest reconsidering the conventional teacher/student paradigm to distill information from multi-modal data to single-modality neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weakly-Supervised Affordance Grounding Guided by Part-Level Semantic Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24103v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on the task of weakly supervised affordance grounding, where a model is trained to identify affordance regions on objects using human-object interaction images and egocentric object images without dense labels. Previous works are mostly built upon class activation maps, which are effective for semantic segmentation but may not be suitable for locating actions and functions. Leveraging recent advanced foundation models, we develop a supervised training pipeline based on pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are generated from an off-the-shelf part segmentation model, guided by a mapping from affordance to part names. Furthermore, we introduce three key enhancements to the baseline model: a label refining stage, a fine-grained feature alignment process, and a lightweight reasoning module. These techniques harness the semantic knowledge of static objects embedded in off-the-shelf foundation models to improve affordance learning, effectively bridging the gap between objects and actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model has achieved a breakthrough improvement over existing methods.

These artifacts, corresponding to high-norm tokens emerging in low-information background areas of images, appear much more severe in Vision Mamba -- they exist prevalently even with the tiny-sized model and activate extensively across background regions. To mitigate this issue, we follow the prior solution of introducing register tokens into Vision Mamba. To better cope with Mamba blocks' uni-directional inference paradigm, two key modifications are introduced: 1) evenly inserting registers throughout the input token sequence, and 2) recycling registers for final decision predictions. We term this new architecture Mamba-R. Qualitative observations suggest, compared to vanilla Vision Mamba, Mamba-R's feature maps appear cleaner and more focused on semantically meaningful regions. Quantitatively, Mamba-R attains stronger performance and scales better. For example, on the ImageNet benchmark, our base-size Mamba-R attains 83.0% accuracy, significantly outperforming Vim-B's 81.8%; furthermore, we provide the first successful scaling to the large model size (i.e., with 341M parameters), attaining a competitive accuracy of 83.6% (84.5% if finetuned with 384x384 inputs). Additional validation on the downstream semantic segmentation task also supports Mamba-R's efficacy.

However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a ${\bf 58.1}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.6}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |

A further challenge arises when models trained on one field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition, and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities. These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical, and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, presented at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025.

This can be attributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as the disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse sensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor, outdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and semantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards training unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint that domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time. In this work, we propose Point-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to enable large-scale, cross-domain generalization in 3D perception. We show that standard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when trained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing strategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain labels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong multi-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains. This work highlights a scalable path forward for 3D understanding: letting the model discover structure in diverse 3D data, rather than imposing it via manual curation or domain supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/point-moe/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/point-moe) |

While these models provide strong visual-language alignment, segmentation models like SAM2 offer precise spatial boundaries for objects. To this end, we propose TextRegion, a simple, effective, and training-free framework that combines the strengths of image-text models and SAM2 to generate powerful text-aligned region tokens. These tokens enable detailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities. They can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world semantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We conduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods. Additionally, our framework is compatible with many image-text models, making it highly practical and easily extensible as stronger models emerge.

However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to complexities in the forest canopy, including shadows, intricate backgrounds, scale variations, and subtle spectral differences among tree species. Compared to the traditional methods, Deep Learning models improve accuracy by extracting informative and discriminative features, but often fall short in capturing the aforementioned complexities. To address these challenges, we propose PerceptiveNet, a novel model incorporating a Logarithmic Gabor-parameterised convolutional layer with trainable filter parameters, alongside a backbone that extracts salient features while capturing extensive context and spatial information through a wider receptive field. We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and standard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through extensive experimentation. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the contributions of individual layers and their combinations to overall model performance, and we evaluate PerceptiveNet as a backbone within a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer model. Our results outperform state-of-the-art models, demonstrating significant performance improvements on a tree crown dataset while generalising across domains, including two benchmark aerial scene semantic segmentation datasets with varying complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) EarthVision</p></details> | None |

To generate high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR) for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, Accepted by Computers & Graphics</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23438v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), data augmentation plays a crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations, which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation (\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Calibrating Undisciplined Over-Smoothing in Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03112v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently attracted considerable attention because it requires fewer annotations than fully supervised approaches, making it especially promising for large-scale image segmentation tasks. Although many vision transformer-based methods leverage self-attention affinity matrices to refine Class Activation Maps (CAMs), they often treat each layer's affinity equally and thus introduce considerable background noise at deeper layers, where attention tends to converge excessively on certain tokens (i.e., over-smoothing). We observe that this deep-level attention naturally converges on a subset of tokens, yet unregulated query-key affinity can generate unpredictable activation patterns (undisciplined over-smoothing), adversely affecting CAM accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Re-Activation Mechanism (AReAM), which exploits shallow-level affinity to guide deeper-layer convergence in an entropy-aware manner, thereby suppressing background noise and re-activating crucial semantic regions in the CAMs. Experiments on two commonly used datasets demonstrate that AReAM substantially improves segmentation performance compared with existing WSSS methods, reducing noise while sharpening focus on relevant semantic regions. Overall, this work underscores the importance of controlling deep-level attention to mitigate undisciplined over-smoothing, introduces an entropy-aware mechanism that harmonizes shallow and deep-level affinities, and provides a refined approach to enhance transformer-based WSSS accuracy by re-activating CAMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23292v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions.

Unfortunately, existing methods often struggle to balance efficiency and performance due to the complexity of feature modeling. Many of these existing approaches are constrained by rigid architectures and implicit representation learning, often characterized by parameter-heavy designs and a reliance on computationally intensive Vision Transformer-based frameworks. In this work, we introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

To solve the aforementioned problems, uncertainty-diffusion-model-based high-Frequency TransFormer network (UDHF2-Net) is the first to be proposed, whose superiorities are as follows: (1) a spatially-stationary-and-non-stationary high-frequency connection paradigm (SHCP) is proposed to enhance the interaction of spatially frequency-wise stationary and non-stationary features to yield high-fidelity edge extraction result. Inspired by HRFormer, SHCP proposes high-frequency-wise stream to replace high-resolution-wise stream in HRFormer through the whole encoder-decoder process with parallel frequency-wise high-to-low streams, so it improves the edge extraction accuracy by continuously remaining high-frequency information; (2) a mask-and-geo-knowledge-based uncertainty diffusion module (MUDM), which is a self-supervised learning strategy, is proposed to improve the edge accuracy of extraction and change detection by gradually removing the simulated spectrum noises based on geo-knowledge and the generated diffused spectrum noises; (3) a frequency-wise semi-pseudo-Siamese UDHF2-Net is the first to be proposed to balance accuracy and complexity for change detection. Besides the aforementioned spectrum noises in semantic segmentation, MUDM is also a self-supervised learning strategy to effectively reduce the edge false change detection from the generated imagery with geometric registration error.</p></details> |  | None |

However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose the complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited to capturing high-dimensional directional features and offers greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines.

Coral reef ecological monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study develops the YH-OSI system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module (mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs, achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior generation-real-time analysis."</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study.

However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reducing the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$ while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
