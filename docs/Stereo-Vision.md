| **[An Image-Based Path Planning Algorithm Using a UAV Equipped with Stereo Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07928v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Evaluation of DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT 3D Reconstruction on Photogrammetric Aerial Blocks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14798v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction (DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps, stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches, especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, this manuscript has been submitted to Geo-spatial Information Science for consideration</p></details> | None |
| **[CogStereo: Neural Stereo Matching with Implicit Spatial Cognition Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22119v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors, capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[GeoDiff: Geometry-Guided Diffusion for Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18291v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models (LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Findings 2025.

| **[Adapting Stereo Vision From Objects To 3D Lunar Surface Reconstruction with the StereoLunar Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18172v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models, trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue, we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo. We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV workshop 2025.

| **[A Recursive Pyramidal Algorithm for Solving the Image Registration Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04231v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LapSurgie: Humanoid Robots Performing Surgery via Teleoperated Handheld Laparoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03529v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback. Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PhraseStereo: The First Open-Vocabulary Stereo Image Segmentation Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00818v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to X-Sense Ego-Exo Sensing for Smart Mobility Workshop at ICCV 2025 Conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-Robot Vision-Based Task and Motion Planning for EV Battery Disassembly and Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21020v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning (TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable, busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2: $0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$ ($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in unstructured, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[End-to-end RL Improves Dexterous Grasping Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16434v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores techniques to scale up image-based end-to-end learning for dexterous grasping with an arm + hand system. Unlike state-based RL, vision-based RL is much more memory inefficient, resulting in relatively low batch sizes, which is not amenable for algorithms like PPO. Nevertheless, it is still an attractive method as unlike the more commonly used techniques which distill state-based policies into vision networks, end-to-end RL can allow for emergent active vision behaviors. We identify a key bottleneck in training these policies is the way most existing simulators scale to multiple GPUs using traditional data parallelism techniques. We propose a new method where we disaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto separate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three of them, and PPO running on the fourth. We are able to show that with the same number of GPUs, we can double the number of existing environments compared to the previous baseline of standard data parallelism. This allows us to train vision-based environments, end-to-end with depth, which were previously performing far worse with the baseline. We train and distill both depth and state-based policies into stereo RGB networks and show that depth distillation leads to better results, both in simulation and reality. This improvement is likely due to the observability gap between state and vision policies which does not exist when distilling depth policies into stereo RGB. We further show that the increased batch size brought about by disaggregated simulation also improves real world performance. When deploying in the real world, we improve upon the previous state-of-the-art vision-based results using our end-to-end policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our blog post: https://e2e4robotics.com/</p></details> | None |
| **[Stereo Anything: Unifying Zero-shot Stereo Matching with Large-Scale Mixed Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14053v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching serves as a cornerstone in 3D vision, aiming to establish pixel-wise correspondences between stereo image pairs for depth recovery. Despite remarkable progress driven by deep neural architectures, current models often exhibit severe performance degradation when deployed in unseen domains, primarily due to the limited diversity of training data. In this work, we introduce StereoAnything, a data-centric framework that substantially enhances the zero-shot generalization capability of existing stereo models. Rather than devising yet another specialized architecture, we scale stereo training to an unprecedented level by systematically unifying heterogeneous stereo sources: (1) curated labeled datasets covering diverse environments, and (2) large-scale synthetic stereo pairs generated from unlabeled monocular images. Our mixed-data strategy delivers consistent and robust learning signals across domains, effectively mitigating dataset bias. Extensive zero-shot evaluations on four public benchmarks demonstrate that Stereo Anything achieves state-of-the-art generalization. This work paves the way towards truly universal stereo matching, offering a scalable data paradigm applicable to any stereo image pair. We extensively evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our model on four public datasets, showcasing its impressive ability to generalize to any stereo image pair.

| **[CLAP: Clustering to Localize Across n Possibilities, A Simple, Robust Geometric Approach in the Presence of Symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08495v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024 adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy. However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architecture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN-based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[Towards Understanding 3D Vision: the Role of Gaussian Curvature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11825v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of 3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised metric for stereo methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SNNSIR: A Simple Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12271v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations, offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration. In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |
| **[Iterative Volume Fusion for Asymmetric Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09543v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching (IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

Current methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance, which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds. To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACMMM...</summary><p>ACMMM2025.

| **[Learning Robust Stereo Matching in the Wild with Selective Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04631v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored, scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

| **[TiCoSS: Tightening the Coupling between Semantic Segmentation and Stereo Matching within A Joint Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18038v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation and stereo matching, respectively analogous to the ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in mIoU by over 9%. Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/TiCoSS upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Secondly, the decoder employs a consistency Schrödinger bridge to facilitate one-step sample generation. Moreover, we utilize the SFE module to improve the consistency of audio-visual matching. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine stereo singing voice synthesis with visual acoustic matching within a unified framework.

Recently, marker-based VBTSs have been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras. \uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface; and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs. Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.</p></details> | 11 pages, 13 figures | None |

Other systems like gaming consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing. Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems, that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17110v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Flying Co-Stereo: Enabling Long-Range Aerial Dense Mapping via Collaborative Stereo Vision of Dynamic-Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00546v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight long-range mapping is critical for safe navigation of UAV swarms in large-scale unknown environments. Traditional stereo vision systems with fixed short baselines face limited perception ranges. To address this, we propose Flying Co-Stereo, a cross-agent collaborative stereo vision system that leverages the wide-baseline spatial configuration of two UAVs for long-range dense mapping. Key innovations include: (1) a dual-spectrum visual-inertial-ranging estimator for robust baseline estimation; (2) a hybrid feature association strategy combining deep learning-based cross-agent matching and optical-flow-based intra-agent tracking; (3) A sparse-to-dense depth recovery scheme,refining dense monocular depth predictions using exponential fitting of long-range triangulated sparse landmarks for precise metric-scale mapping. Experiments demonstrate the Flying Co-Stereo system achieves dense 3D mapping up to 70 meters with 2.3%-9.7% relative error, outperforming conventional systems by up to 350% in depth range and 450% in coverage area.

| **[Distance Estimation in Outdoor Driving Environments Using Phase-only Correlation Method with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17582v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems. Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light. In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters. Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

While traditional marker-based methods offer accuracy, they face challenges with occlusions, reflections, and tool-specific designs. Similarly, supervised learning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting their adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains, zero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation of surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical tools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation pipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D models like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by incorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for robust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments. Additionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive validation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in zero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new benchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the generalisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the application of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

Despite advances in medical imaging technologies, transforming static or limited dynamic imaging data into comprehensive dynamic cardiac models remains challenging. Existing training systems lack accurate simulation of cardiac physiological dynamics. This study develops a comprehensive dynamic cardiac model research framework based on 4D-CTA, integrating digital twin technology, computer vision, and physical model manufacturing to provide precise, personalized tools for interventional cardiology. Methods: Using 4D-CTA data from a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented cardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and implemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation across 20 cardiac phases. Transparent vascular physical models were manufactured using medical-grade silicone. We developed cardiac output analysis and virtual angiography systems, implemented guidewire 3D reconstruction using binocular stereo vision, and evaluated the system through angiography validation and CABG training applications. Results: Morphological consistency between virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%. Dice similarity coefficients for guidewire motion ranged from 0.741-0.812, with mean trajectory errors below 1.1 mm. The transparent model demonstrated advantages in CABG training, allowing direct visualization while simulating beating heart challenges. Conclusion: Our patient-specific digital-physical twin approach effectively reproduces both anatomical structures and dynamic characteristics of coronary vasculature, offering a dynamic environment with visual and tactile feedback valuable for education and clinical planning.</p></details> | 34 pages, 24 figures | None |

Hence, the resilience of models to such real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models. RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur, color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-, stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset, creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type. RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It will be available at https://spring-benchmark.org.</p></details> |  | None |

The system integrates a 6-degree-of-freedom manipulator with a stereo vision pipeline to identify and interact with target leaves. YOLOv8 is used for real-time leaf segmentation, and RAFT-Stereo provides dense depth maps, allowing the reconstruction of 3D leaf masks. These observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets, achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant sampling automation in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics.

This control command data is leveraged to add constraints on the velocity state. Hover constraints can be considered important dynamic model information, such as the exploitation of zero-velocity updates in pedestrian navigation. We analyze the benefits of these constraints using an incremental factor graph optimization.

However, achieving strong zero-shot generalization - a hallmark of foundation models in other computer vision tasks - remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to achieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and accuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth estimation.

To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

However, most existing approaches do not generalize well across different domains and scene types (e.g. indoor vs. outdoor). Training a general-purpose multi-view stereo model is challenging and raises several questions, e.g. how to best make use of transformer-based architectures, how to incorporate additional metadata when there is a variable number of input views, and how to estimate the range of valid depths which can vary considerably across different scenes and is typically not known a priori? To address these issues, we introduce MVSA, a novel and versatile Multi-View Stereo architecture that aims to work Anywhere by generalizing across diverse domains and depth ranges. MVSA combines monocular and multi-view cues with an adaptive cost volume to deal with scale-related issues. We demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot depth estimation on the Robust Multi-View Depth Benchmark, surpassing existing multi-view stereo and monocular baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

One of the reasons for its lack of use in stereo matching networks is due to the inherent complexity of these networks, where a typical network is composed of multiple two- and three-dimensional modules. In this work, we systematically combine the insights from state-of-the-art stereo methods with general knowledge-distillation techniques to develop a joint framework for stereo networks distillation with competitive results and faster inference. Moreover, we show, via a detailed empirical analysis, that distilling knowledge from the stereo network requires careful design of the complete distillation pipeline starting from backbone to the right selection of distillation points and corresponding loss functions. This results in the student networks that are not only leaner and faster but give excellent performance . For instance, our student network while performing better than the performance oriented methods like PSMNet [1], CFNet [2], and LEAStereo [3]) on benchmark SceneFlow dataset, is 8x, 5x, and 8x faster respectively. Furthermore, compared to speed oriented methods having inference time less than 100ms, our student networks perform better than all the tested methods. In addition, our student network also shows better generalization capabilities when tested on unseen datasets like ETH3D and Middlebury.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Our key innovation consists of augmenting the standard neural representation by a normalizing flow network. As a result, achieving strong representation power on the specific class of road vehicles is made possible by compact networks with only 16-dimensional latent codes. Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings. The proposed method performs well with only sparse 3D points obtained from bundle adjustment, and eventually continues to deliver stable results even under exclusive use of the mask-consistency term.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, IROS 2024</p></details> | None |

More specifically, a machine vision-oriented stereo feature compression network (MVSFC-Net) is proposed for SICM, where the stereo visual features are effectively extracted, compressed, and transmitted for 3D visual task. To efficiently compress stereo visual features in MVSFC-Net, a stereo multi-scale feature compression (SMFC) module is designed to gradually transform sparse stereo multi-scale features into compact joint visual representations by removing spatial, inter-view, and cross-scale redundancies simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed MVSFC-Net obtains superior compression efficiency as well as 3D visual task performance, when compared with the existing ICM anchors recommended by MPEG and the state-of-the-art SIC method.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated improved normal reconstruction accuracy by using learned display patterns. However, DDPS faced limitations in practicality, requiring a fixed desktop imaging setup using a polarization camera and a desktop-scale monitor. In this paper, we propose a more practical physics-based photometric stereo, differentiable mobile display photometric stereo (DMDPS), that leverages a mobile phone consisting of a display and a camera. We overcome the limitations of using a mobile device by developing a mobile app and method that simultaneously displays patterns and captures high-quality HDR images. Using this technique, we capture real-world 3D-printed objects and learn display patterns via a differentiable learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDPS on both a 3D printed dataset and a first dataset of fallen leaves. The leaf dataset contains reconstructed surface normals and albedos of fallen leaves that may enable future research beyond computer graphics and vision. We believe that DMDPS takes a step forward for practical physics-based photometric stereo.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

However, the fast flight speed of the shuttlecock, along with various visual effects, and its tendency to blend with environmental elements, such as court lines and lighting, present challenges for rapid and accurate 2D detection. In this paper, we first propose the YO-CSA detection network, which optimizes and reconfigures the YOLOv8s model's backbone, neck, and head by incorporating contextual and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance model's ability in extracting and integrating both global and local features. Next, we integrate three major subtasks, detection, prediction, and compensation, into a real-time 3D shuttlecock trajectory detection system. Specifically, our system maps the 2D coordinate sequence extracted by YO-CSA into 3D space using stereo vision, then predicts the future 3D coordinates based on historical information, and re-projects them onto the left and right views to update the position constraints for 2D detection. Additionally, our system includes a compensation module to fill in missing intermediate frames, ensuring a more complete trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments on our own dataset to evaluate both YO-CSA's performance and system effectiveness. Experimental results show that YO-CSA achieves a high accuracy of 90.43% mAP@0.75, surpassing both YOLOv8s and YOLO11s. Our system performs excellently, maintaining a speed of over 130 fps across 12 test sequences.</p></details> | 8 pages,14 figures | None |

Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed</p></details> |  | None |

While recent iterative optimization-based methods have achieved promising performance, their feature extraction capabilities still have room for improvement. Inspired by the ability of vision foundation models (VFMs) to extract general representations, in this work, we propose AIO-Stereo which can flexibly select and transfer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous VFMs to a single stereo matching model. To better reconcile features between heterogeneous VFMs and the stereo matching model and fully exploit prior knowledge from VFMs, we proposed a dual-level feature utilization mechanism that aligns heterogeneous features and transfers multi-level knowledge. Based on the mechanism, a dual-level selective knowledge transfer module is designed to selectively transfer knowledge and integrate the advantages of multiple VFMs. Experimental results show that AIO-Stereo achieves start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on the Middlebury dataset and outperforms all the published work on the ETH3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite the development of numerous impressive methods in recent years, determining the most suitable architecture for practical application remains challenging. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark focusing on practical applicability rather than solely on individual models for optimized performance. Specifically, we develop a flexible and efficient stereo matching codebase, called OpenStereo. OpenStereo includes training and inference codes of more than 10 network models, making it, to our knowledge, the most complete stereo matching toolbox available. Based on OpenStereo, we conducted experiments and have achieved or surpassed the performance metrics reported in the original paper. Additionally, we conduct an exhaustive analysis and deconstruction of recent developments in stereo matching through comprehensive ablative experiments. These investigations inspired the creation of StereoBase, a strong baseline model. Our StereoBase ranks 1st on SceneFlow, KITTI 2015, 2012 (Reflective) among published methods and achieves the best performance across all metrics.

Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

As a result, the accuracy of existing stereo depth estimation methods is often compromised by under- or over-exposed images. Here, we introduce dual-exposure stereo for extended dynamic range 3D imaging. We develop automatic dual-exposure control method that adjusts the dual exposures, diverging them when the scene DR exceeds the camera DR, thereby providing information about broader DR. From the captured dual-exposure stereo images, we estimate depth using motion-aware dual-exposure stereo network. To validate our method, we develop a robot-vision system, collect stereo video datasets, and generate a synthetic dataset.

However, existing works only focus event data within the confines of task-specific domains, overlooking how tasks across the temporal and spatial domains can reinforce each other. In this paper, we reformulate event-based flow estimation and stereo matching as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, enabling us to solve both tasks within a single model by directly matching features in a shared representation space. Specifically, our method utilizes a Temporal Recurrent Network to aggregate event features across temporal or spatial domains, and a Spatial Contextual Attention to enhance knowledge transfer across event flows via temporal or spatial interactions. By utilizing a shared feature similarities module that integrates knowledge from event streams via temporal or spatial interactions, our network performs optical flow estimation from temporal event segment inputs and stereo matching from spatial event segment inputs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our unified model inherently supports multi-task fusion and cross-task transfer. Without the need for retraining for specific task, our model can effectively handle both optical flow and stereo estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches have primarily employed a unidirectional paradigm, where the compression of one view is dependent on the other, resulting in imbalanced compression. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric bidirectional stereo image compression architecture, named BiSIC. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution based codec backbone to capture local features and incorporate bidirectional attention blocks to exploit global features. Moreover, we design a novel cross-dimensional entropy model that integrates various conditioning factors, including the spatial context, channel context, and stereo dependency, to effectively estimate the distribution of latent representations for entropy coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed BiSIC outperforms conventional image/video compression standards, as well as state-of-the-art learning-based methods, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness.

Yet, a real-world active stereo or ToF depth camera often produces noisy and incomplete depth which bottlenecks robot performances. In this work, we propose D3RoMa, a learning-based depth estimation framework on stereo image pairs that predicts clean and accurate depth in diverse indoor scenes, even in the most challenging scenarios with translucent or specular surfaces where classical depth sensing completely fails. Key to our method is that we unify depth estimation and restoration into an image-to-image translation problem by predicting the disparity map with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. At inference time, we further incorporated a left-right consistency constraint as classifier guidance to the diffusion process. Our framework combines recently advanced learning-based approaches and geometric constraints from traditional stereo vision. For model training, we create a large scene-level synthetic dataset with diverse transparent and specular objects to compensate for existing tabletop datasets. The trained model can be directly applied to real-world in-the-wild scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple public depth estimation benchmarks. Further experiments in real environments show that accurate depth prediction significantly improves robotic manipulation in various scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

LiDAR sensors are integral in these systems for object identification and localization. However, LiDAR systems though effective in detecting solid objects (e.g., trash bin, bottle, etc.), encounter limitations in identifying semitransparent or non-tangible objects (e.g., fire, smoke, steam, etc.) due to poor reflecting characteristics. Additionally, LiDAR also fails to detect features such as navigation signs and often struggles to detect certain hazardous materials that lack a distinct surface for effective laser reflection. In this paper, we propose a highly accurate stereo-vision approach to complement LiDAR in autonomous robots. The system employs advanced stereo vision-based object detection to detect both tangible and non-tangible objects and then uses simple machine learning to precisely estimate the depth and size of the object. The depth and size information is then integrated into the SLAM process to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities in complex environments. Our evaluation, conducted on an autonomous robot equipped with LiDAR and stereo-vision systems demonstrates high accuracy in the estimation of an object's depth and size.

In this paper, we propose UniTT-Stereo, a method to maximize the potential of Transformer-based stereo architectures by unifying self-supervised learning used for pre-training with stereo matching framework based on supervised learning. To be specific, we explore the effectiveness of reconstructing features of masked portions in an input image and at the same time predicting corresponding points in another image from the perspective of locality inductive bias, which is crucial in training models with limited training data. Moreover, to address these challenging tasks of reconstruction-and-prediction, we present a new strategy to vary a masking ratio when training the stereo model with stereo-tailored losses. State-of-the-art performance of UniTT-Stereo is validated on various benchmarks such as ETH3D, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 datasets.

Among these, notched tubular continuum robots (NTCR) show great potential in many delicate applications. Existing works in robotic modeling focus on kinematics and dynamics but still face challenges in reproducing the robot's morphology -- a significant factor that can expand the research landscape of continuum robots, especially for those with asymmetric continuum structures. This paper proposes a dual stereo vision-based method for the three-dimensional morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale NTCRs. The method employs two oppositely located stationary binocular cameras to capture the point cloud of the NTCR, then utilizes predefined geometry as a reference for the KD tree method to relocate the capture point clouds, resulting in a morphologically correct NTCR despite the low-quality raw point cloud collection. The method has been proved feasible for an NTCR with a 3.5 mm diameter, capturing 14 out of 16 notch features, with the measurements generally centered around the standard of 1.5 mm, demonstrating the capability of revealing morphological details. Our proposed method paves the way for 3D morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale soft robots for further self-modeling study.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Robio 2024</p></details> | None |

Many studies use deep learning for event camera stereo disparity estimation. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the temporal information in the event stream to acquire clear event representations. Additionally, there is room for further reduction in pixel shifts in the feature maps before constructing the cost volume. In this paper, we propose EV-MGDispNet, a novel event-based stereo disparity estimation method. Firstly, we propose an edge-aware aggregation (EAA) module, which fuses event frames and motion confidence maps to generate a novel clear event representation. Then, we propose a motion-guided attention (MGA) module, where motion confidence maps utilize deformable transformer encoders to enhance the feature map with more accurate edges. Finally, we also add a census left-right consistency loss function to enhance the left-right consistency of stereo event representation. Through conducting experiments within challenging real-world driving scenarios, we validate that our method outperforms currently known state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-based online road reconstruction promisingly captures road information in advance. Existing solutions like monocular depth estimation and stereo matching suffer from modest performance. The recent technique of Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception provides immense potential to more reliable and accurate reconstruction. This paper uniformly proposes two simple yet effective models for road elevation reconstruction in BEV named RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo, which estimate road elevation with monocular and stereo images, respectively. The former directly fits elevation values based on voxel features queried from image view, while the latter efficiently recognizes road elevation patterns based on BEV volume representing correlation between left and right voxel features. Insightful analyses reveal their consistence and difference with the perspective view. Experiments on real-world dataset verify the models' effectiveness and superiority. Elevation errors of RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo achieve 1.83 cm and 0.50 cm, respectively. Our models are promising for practical road preview, providing essential information for promoting safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles.

| **[Temporal Event Stereo via Joint Learning with Stereoscopic Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10831v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are dynamic vision sensors inspired by the biological retina, characterized by their high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low power consumption. These features make them capable of perceiving 3D environments even in extreme conditions. Event data is continuous across the time dimension, which allows a detailed description of each pixel's movements. To fully utilize the temporally dense and continuous nature of event cameras, we propose a novel temporal event stereo, a framework that continuously uses information from previous time steps. This is accomplished through the simultaneous training of an event stereo matching network alongside stereoscopic flow, a new concept that captures all pixel movements from stereo cameras. Since obtaining ground truth for optical flow during training is challenging, we propose a method that uses only disparity maps to train the stereoscopic flow. The performance of event-based stereo matching is enhanced by temporally aggregating information using the flows. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MVSEC and the DSEC datasets. The method is computationally efficient, as it stacks previous information in a cascading manner. The code is available at https://github.com/mickeykang16/TemporalEventStereo.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 | [Code Link](https://github.com/mickeykang16/TemporalEventStereo) |

Digital Twins (DT) are one such transformational technology that leverages software systems to replicate physical process behavior, representing the physical process in a digital environment. This paper aims to explore the use of photogrammetry (which is the process of reconstructing physical objects into virtual 3D models using photographs) and 3D Scanning techniques to create accurate visual representation of the 'Physical Process', to interact with the ML/AI based behavior models. To achieve this, we have used a readily available consumer device, the iPhone 15 Pro, which features stereo vision capabilities, to capture the depth of an Industry 4.0 system. By processing these images using 3D scanning tools, we created a raw 3D model for 3D modeling and rendering software for the creation of a DT model. The paper highlights the reliability of this method by measuring the error rate in between the ground truth (measurements done manually using a tape measure) and the final 3D model created using this method. The overall mean error is 4.97\% and the overall standard deviation error is 5.54\% between the ground truth measurements and their photogrammetry counterparts. The results from this work indicate that photogrammetry using consumer-grade devices can be an efficient and cost-efficient approach to creating DTs for smart manufacturing, while the approaches flexibility allows for iterative improvements of the models over time.</p></details> |  | None |

Another concern often encountered is the unsatisfying results yielded when directly applying pre-trained single-image models to multi-image domain. In this paper, we propose a efficient method for transferring a pre-trained single-image super-resolution (SISR) transformer network to the domain of stereo image super-resolution (SteISR) through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Specifically, we introduce the concept of stereo adapters and spatial adapters which are incorporated into the pre-trained SISR transformer network. Subsequently, the pre-trained SISR model is frozen, enabling us to fine-tune the adapters using stereo datasets along. By adopting this training method, we enhance the ability of the SISR model to accurately infer stereo images by 0.79dB on the Flickr1024 dataset. This method allows us to train only 4.8% of the original model parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four commonly used SteISR benchmarks. Compared to the more complicated full fine-tuning approach, our method reduces training time and memory consumption by 57% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stereo Risk: A Continuous Modeling Approach to Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03152v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Stereo Risk, a new deep-learning approach to solve the classical stereo-matching problem in computer vision. As it is well-known that stereo matching boils down to a per-pixel disparity estimation problem, the popular state-of-the-art stereo-matching approaches widely rely on regressing the scene disparity values, yet via discretization of scene disparity values. Such discretization often fails to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of scene depth. Stereo Risk departs from the conventional discretization approach by formulating the scene disparity as an optimal solution to a continuous risk minimization problem, hence the name "stereo risk". We demonstrate that $L^1$ minimization of the proposed continuous risk function enhances stereo-matching performance for deep networks, particularly for disparities with multi-modal probability distributions. Furthermore, to enable the end-to-end network training of the non-differentiable $L^1$ risk optimization, we exploited the implicit function theorem, ensuring a fully differentiable network. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates our method's theoretical soundness and superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, SceneFlow, and Middlebury 2014.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Paper at ICML 2024.

With the help of stereovision and machine learning, it will be able to mimic human-like visual system and behaviour towards the environment. In this paper, we present a stereo vision based 3-DOF robot which will be used to monitor places from remote using cloud server and internet devices. The 3-DOF robot will transmit human-like head movements, i.e., yaw, pitch, roll and produce 3D stereoscopic video and stream it in Real-time. This video stream is sent to the user through any generic internet devices with VR box support, i.e., smartphones giving the user a First-person real-time 3D experience and transfers the head motion of the user to the robot also in Real-time. The robot will also be able to track moving objects and faces as a target using deep neural networks which enables it to be a standalone monitoring robot. The user will be able to choose specific subjects to monitor in a space. The stereovision enables us to track the depth information of different objects detected and will be used to track human interest objects with its distances and sent to the cloud. A full working prototype is developed which showcases the capabilities of a monitoring system based on stereo vision, robotics, and machine learning.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 10 Figures | None |

This challenge faces difficulties in drone detection, UAV-type classification and 2D/3D trajectory estimation in extreme weather conditions with multi-modal sensor information, including stereo vision, various Lidars, Radars, and audio arrays.

Current stereo matching methods generally adopt the deep Siamese neural network architecture, and have achieved impressing performance by constructing feature matching cost volumes and using 3D convolutions for cost aggregation. However, most existing methods suffer from large number of parameters and slow running time due to the sequential use of 3D convolutions. In this paper, we propose Ghost-Stereo, a novel end-to-end stereo matching network. The feature extraction part of the network uses the GhostNet to form a U-shaped structure. The core of Ghost-Stereo is a GhostNet feature-based cost volume enhancement (Ghost-CVE) module and a GhostNet-inspired lightweight cost volume aggregation (Ghost-CVA) module. For the Ghost-CVE part, cost volumes are constructed and fused by the GhostNet-based features to enhance the spatial context awareness. For the Ghost-CVA part, a lightweight 3D convolution bottleneck block based on the GhostNet is proposed to reduce the computational complexity in this module. By combining with the context and geometry fusion module, a classical hourglass-shaped cost volume aggregate structure is constructed. Ghost-Stereo achieves a comparable performance than state-of-the-art real-time methods on several publicly benchmarks, and shows a better generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

The cost volume building process is often computationally heavy considering the limited resources a mobile robot has. We propose a new geometry-informed way of distance candidates selection method which enables the use of a very small number of candidates and reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate the use of the geometry-informed candidates in a set of model variants. We find that by adjusting the candidates during robot deployment, our geometry-informed distance candidates also improve a pre-trained model's accuracy if the extrinsics or the number of cameras changes. Without any re-training or fine-tuning, our models outperform models trained with evenly distributed distance candidates. Models are also released as hardware-accelerated versions with a new dedicated large-scale dataset.

| **[DMODE: Differential Monocular Object Distance Estimation Module without Class Specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12596v3)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing a single camera for measuring object distances is a cost-effective alternative to stereo-vision and LiDAR. Although monocular distance estimation has been explored in the literature, most existing techniques rely on object class knowledge to achieve high performance. Without this contextual data, monocular distance estimation becomes more challenging, lacking reference points and object-specific cues. However, these cues can be misleading for objects with wide-range variation or adversarial situations, which is a challenging aspect of object-agnostic distance estimation. In this paper, we propose DMODE, a class-agnostic method for monocular distance estimation that does not require object class knowledge. DMODE estimates an object's distance by fusing its fluctuation in size over time with the camera's motion, making it adaptable to various object detectors and unknown objects, thus addressing these challenges. We evaluate our model on the KITTI MOTS dataset using ground-truth bounding box annotations and outputs from TrackRCNN and EagerMOT. The object's location is determined using the change in bounding box sizes and camera position without measuring the object's detection source or class attributes. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-class object distance detection scenarios compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Moreover, traditional depth-dependent distortion models and their calibration methods have remained complicated. In this work, we propose a minimal set of parameters based depth-dependent distortion model (MDM), which considers the radial and decentering distortions of the lens to improve the accuracy of stereo vision systems and simplify their calibration process. In addition, we present an easy and flexible calibration method for the MDM of stereo vision systems with a commonly used planar pattern, which requires cameras to observe the planar pattern in different orientations. The proposed technique is easy to use and flexible compared with classical calibration techniques for depth-dependent distortion models in which the lens must be perpendicular to the planar pattern. The experimental validation of the MDM and its calibration method showed that the MDM improved the calibration accuracy by 56.55% and 74.15% compared with the Li's distortion model and traditional Brown's distortion model. Besides, an iteration-based reconstruction method is proposed to iteratively estimate the depth information in the MDM during three-dimensional reconstruction. The results showed that the accuracy of the iteration-based reconstruction method was improved by 9.08% compared with that of the non-iteration reconstruction method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> | None |
| **[Playing to Vision Foundation Model's Strengths in Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06261v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching has become a key technique for 3D environment perception in intelligent vehicles. For a considerable time, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have remained the mainstream choice for feature extraction in this domain. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that the existing paradigm should evolve towards vision foundation models (VFM), particularly those developed based on vision Transformers (ViTs) and pre-trained through self-supervision on extensive, unlabeled datasets. While VFMs are adept at extracting informative, general-purpose visual features, specifically for dense prediction tasks, their performance often lacks in geometric vision tasks. This study serves as the first exploration of a viable approach for adapting VFMs to stereo matching. Our ViT adapter, referred to as ViTAS, is constructed upon three types of modules: spatial differentiation, patch attention fusion, and cross-attention. The first module initializes feature pyramids, while the latter two aggregate stereo and multi-scale contextual information into fine-grained features, respectively. ViTAStereo, which combines ViTAS with cost volume-based stereo matching back-end processes, achieves the top rank on the KITTI Stereo 2012 dataset and outperforms the second-best network StereoBase by approximately 7.9% in terms of the percentage of error pixels, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. Additional experiments across diverse scenarios further demonstrate its superior generalizability compared to all other state-of-the-art approaches. We believe this new paradigm will pave the way for the next generation of stereo matching networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these pipelines are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows, reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate the learning.

In the first segment, the thesis introduces structural enhancements to both monocular and stereo 3D object detection algorithms. By integrating ground-referenced geometric priors into monocular detection models, this research achieves unparalleled accuracy in benchmark evaluations for monocular 3D detection. Concurrently, the work refines stereo 3D detection paradigms by incorporating insights and inferential structures gleaned from monocular networks, thereby augmenting the operational efficiency of stereo detection systems. The second segment is devoted to data-driven strategies and their real-world applications in 3D vision detection. A novel training regimen is introduced that amalgamates datasets annotated with either 2D or 3D labels. This approach not only augments the detection models through the utilization of a substantially expanded dataset but also facilitates economical model deployment in real-world scenarios where only 2D annotations are readily available. Lastly, the dissertation presents an innovative pipeline tailored for unsupervised depth estimation in autonomous driving contexts. Extensive empirical analyses affirm the robustness and efficacy of this newly proposed pipeline.

Existing range-free localization methods rely on radio-based anchors and their average hop distance which suffers from accuracy and stability in dynamic and sparse wireless network topology. Vision-based methods like SLAM and Visual Odometry use expensive sensor fusion techniques for map generation and pose estimation. This paper proposes a novel framework for localization in non-GPS battlefield environments using only the passive camera sensors and considering naturally existing or artificial landmarks as anchors. The proposed method utilizes a customcalibrated stereo vision camera for distance estimation and the YOLOv8s model, which is trained and fine-tuned with our real-world dataset for landmark recognition. The depth images are generated using an efficient stereomatching algorithm, and distances to landmarks are determined by extracting the landmark depth feature utilizing a bounding box predicted by the landmark recognition model. The position of the unknown node is then obtained using the efficient least square algorithm and then optimized using the L-BFGS-B (limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization) method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework performs better than existing anchorbased DV-Hop algorithms and competes with the most efficient vision-based algorithms in terms of localization error (RMSE).</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.12320</p></details> | None |

The proposed strategy implements landmark recognition using the Yolov5 model and landmark distance estimation using an efficient Stereo Matching Algorithm. We consider that a moving node carrying a low-power mobile device facilitated with a calibrated stereo vision camera that captures stereo images of a scene containing landmarks within the battlefield region whose locations are stored in an offline server residing within the device itself. We created a custom landmark image dataset called MSTLandmarkv1 with 34 landmark classes and another landmark stereo dataset of those 34 landmark instances called MSTLandmarkStereov1. We trained the YOLOv5 model with MSTLandmarkv1 dataset and achieved 0.95 mAP @ 0.5 IoU and 0.767 mAP @ [0.5: 0.95] IoU. We calculated the distance from a node to the landmark utilizing the bounding box coordinates and the depth map generated by the improved SGM algorithm using MSTLandmarkStereov1. The tuple of landmark IDs obtained from the detection result and the distances calculated by the SGM algorithm are stored as the virtual coordinates of a node. In future work, we will use these virtual coordinates to obtain the location of a node using an efficient trilateration algorithm and optimize the node position using the appropriate optimization method.</p></details> |  | None |

The similarity between these intermediate left-right features significantly impacts the accuracy of disparity estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach that generates perturbation noise specifically designed to maximize the discrepancy between left and right image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of our method to induce larger prediction errors in stereo neural networks, e.g. outperforming existing state-of-the-art attack methods by 219% MAE on the KITTI dataset and 85% MAE on the Scene Flow dataset. Additionally, we extend our approach to include a proxy network black-box attack method, eliminating the need for access to stereo neural network. This method leverages an arbitrary network from a different vision task as a proxy to generate adversarial noise, effectively causing the stereo network to produce erroneous predictions. Our findings highlight a notable sensitivity of stereo networks to discrepancies in shallow layer features, offering valuable insights that could guide future research in enhancing the robustness of stereo vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Utilizing AUVs in underwater human-robot interaction (UHRI) has witnessed comparatively smaller levels of growth due to limitations in bi-directional communication and significant technical hurdles to bridge the gap between analogies with terrestrial interaction strategies and those that are possible in the underwater domain. A necessary component to support UHRI is establishing a system for safe robotic-diver approach to establish face-to-face communication that considers non-standard human body pose. In this work, we introduce a stereo vision system for enhancing UHRI that utilizes three-dimensional reconstruction from stereo image pairs and machine learning for localizing human joint estimates. We then establish a convention for a coordinate system that encodes the direction the human is facing with respect to the camera coordinate frame. This allows automatic setpoint computation that preserves human body scale and can be used as input to an image-based visual servo control scheme. We show that our setpoint computations tend to agree both quantitatively and qualitatively with experimental setpoint baselines. The methodology introduced shows promise for enhancing UHRI by improving robotic perception of human orientation underwater.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

TeFS is designed to overcome the lack of native stereo vision support in commercial driving simulators, and we demonstrate its effectiveness using Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), a high-budget open-world video game engine. We introduce GTAV-TeFS, the first large-scale GTA V stereo-driving dataset, containing over 88,000 high-resolution stereo RGB image pairs, along with temporal information, GPS coordinates, camera poses, and full-resolution dense depth maps. GTAV-TeFS offers several advantages over other synthetic stereo datasets and enables the evaluation and enhancement of state-of-the-art stereo vSLAM models under GTA V's environment. We validate the quality of the stereo data collected using TeFS by conducting a comparative analysis with the conventional dual-viewport data using an open-source simulator. We also benchmark various vSLAM models using the challenging-case comparison groups included in GTAV-TeFS, revealing the distinct advantages and limitations inherent to each model.

| **[Toward Real World Stereo Image Super-Resolution via Hybrid Degradation Model and Discriminator for Implied Stereo Image Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07934v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world stereo image super-resolution has a significant influence on enhancing the performance of computer vision systems. Although existing methods for single-image super-resolution can be applied to improve stereo images, these methods often introduce notable modifications to the inherent disparity, resulting in a loss in the consistency of disparity between the original and the enhanced stereo images. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates a implicit stereo information discriminator and a hybrid degradation model. This combination ensures effective enhancement while preserving disparity consistency. The proposed method bridges the gap between the complex degradations in real-world stereo domain and the simpler degradations in real-world single-image super-resolution domain. Our results demonstrate impressive performance on synthetic and real datasets, enhancing visual perception while maintaining disparity consistency.

While this task is an essential component of many surgeries, it involves substantial human effort and is prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we develop a novel human-AI-based method for laparoscopic measurements utilizing stereo vision that has been guided by practicing surgeons. Based on a holistic qualitative requirements analysis, this work proposes a comprehensive measurement method, which comprises state-of-the-art machine learning architectures, such as RAFT-Stereo and YOLOv8. The developed method is assessed in various realistic experimental evaluation environments. Our results outline the potential of our method achieving high accuracies in distance measurements with errors below 1 mm. Furthermore, on-surface measurements demonstrate robustness when applied in challenging environments with textureless regions. Overall, by addressing the inherent challenges of image-guided surgery, we lay the foundation for a more robust and accurate solution for intra- and postoperative measurements, enabling more precise, safe, and efficient surgical procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-24)</p></details> | None |

Traditional dense stereo vision for distance estimation underwater is challenging because of the relative lack of saliency of scene features and degraded lighting conditions. Yet, including distance information is necessary for robotic perception of diver pointing when multiple objects appear within the robot's image plane. We subvert the challenges of underwater distance estimation by using sparse reconstruction of keypoints to perform pose estimation on both the left and right images from the robot's stereo camera. Triangulated pose keypoints, along with a classical object detection method, enable DIP-3D to infer the location of an object of interest when multiple objects are in the AUV's field of view. By allowing the scuba diver to point at an arbitrary object of interest and enabling the AUV to autonomously decide which object the diver is pointing to, this method will permit more natural interaction between AUVs and human scuba divers in underwater-human robot collaborative tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review International Conference of Robotics and Automation 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[AGG-Net: Attention Guided Gated-convolutional Network for Depth Image Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01624v1)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, stereo vision based on lightweight RGBD cameras has been widely used in various fields. However, limited by the imaging principles, the commonly used RGB-D cameras based on TOF, structured light, or binocular vision acquire some invalid data inevitably, such as weak reflection, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which may bring adverse impacts to the follow-up work. In this paper, we propose a new model for depth image completion based on the Attention Guided Gated-convolutional Network (AGG-Net), through which more accurate and reliable depth images can be obtained from the raw depth maps and the corresponding RGB images. Our model employs a UNet-like architecture which consists of two parallel branches of depth and color features. In the encoding stage, an Attention Guided Gated-Convolution (AG-GConv) module is proposed to realize the fusion of depth and color features at different scales, which can effectively reduce the negative impacts of invalid depth data on the reconstruction. In the decoding stage, an Attention Guided Skip Connection (AG-SC) module is presented to avoid introducing too many depth-irrelevant features to the reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the popular benchmarks NYU-Depth V2, DIML, and SUN RGB-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, ICCV2023</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffuVolume: Diffusion Model for Volume based Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15989v1)** | 2023-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching is a significant part in many computer vision tasks and driving-based applications. Recently cost volume-based methods have achieved great success benefiting from the rich geometry information in paired images. However, the redundancy of cost volume also interferes with the model training and limits the performance. To construct a more precise cost volume, we pioneeringly apply the diffusion model to stereo matching. Our method, termed DiffuVolume, considers the diffusion model as a cost volume filter, which will recurrently remove the redundant information from the cost volume. Two main designs make our method not trivial. Firstly, to make the diffusion model more adaptive to stereo matching, we eschew the traditional manner of directly adding noise into the image but embed the diffusion model into a task-specific module. In this way, we outperform the traditional diffusion stereo matching method by 22% EPE improvement and 240 times inference acceleration. Secondly, DiffuVolume can be easily embedded into any volume-based stereo matching network with boost performance but slight parameters rise (only 2%). By adding the DiffuVolume into well-performed methods, we outperform all the published methods on Scene Flow, KITTI2012, KITTI2015 benchmarks and zero-shot generalization setting. It is worth mentioning that the proposed model ranks 1st on KITTI 2012 leader board, 2nd on KITTI 2015 leader board since 15, July 2023.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[CroCo v2: Improved Cross-view Completion Pre-training for Stereo Matching and Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10408v3)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive performance for high-level downstream tasks, self-supervised pre-training methods have not yet fully delivered on dense geometric vision tasks such as stereo matching or optical flow. The application of self-supervised concepts, such as instance discrimination or masked image modeling, to geometric tasks is an active area of research. In this work, we build on the recent cross-view completion framework, a variation of masked image modeling that leverages a second view from the same scene which makes it well suited for binocular downstream tasks. The applicability of this concept has so far been limited in at least two ways: (a) by the difficulty of collecting real-world image pairs -- in practice only synthetic data have been used -- and (b) by the lack of generalization of vanilla transformers to dense downstream tasks for which relative position is more meaningful than absolute position. We explore three avenues of improvement. First, we introduce a method to collect suitable real-world image pairs at large scale. Second, we experiment with relative positional embeddings and show that they enable vision transformers to perform substantially better. Third, we scale up vision transformer based cross-completion architectures, which is made possible by the use of large amounts of data. With these improvements, we show for the first time that state-of-the-art results on stereo matching and optical flow can be reached without using any classical task-specific techniques like correlation volume, iterative estimation, image warping or multi-scale reasoning, thus paving the way towards universal vision models.</p></details> | ICCV 2023 | None |
| **[Stereo Event-based Visual-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05086v4)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based cameras are new type vision sensors whose pixels work independently and respond asynchronously to brightness change with microsecond resolution, instead of providing standard intensity frames. Compared with traditional cameras, event-based cameras have low latency, no motion blur, and high dynamic range (HDR), which provide possibilities for robots to deal with some challenging scenes. We propose a visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras based on Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). The visual module updates the pose relies on the edge alignment of a semi-dense 3D map to a 2D image, and the IMU module updates pose by median integral. We evaluate our method on public datasets with general 6-DoF motion and compare the results against ground truth. We show that our proposed pipeline provides improved accuracy over the result of the state-of-the-art visual odometry for stereo event-based cameras, while running in real-time on a standard CPU (low-resolution cameras). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published visual-inertial odometry for stereo event-based cameras.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Depth Estimation Analysis of Orthogonally Divergent Fisheye Cameras with Distortion Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03602v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo vision systems have become popular in computer vision applications, such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and autonomous navigation. However, traditional stereo vision systems that use rectilinear lenses may not be suitable for certain scenarios due to their limited field of view. This has led to the popularity of vision systems based on one or multiple fisheye cameras in different orientations, which can provide a field of view of 180x180 degrees or more. However, fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion at the edges that affects the accuracy of stereo matching and depth estimation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a method for distortion-removal and depth estimation analysis for stereovision system using orthogonally divergent fisheye cameras (ODFC). The proposed method uses two virtual pinhole cameras (VPC), each VPC captures a small portion of the original view and presents it without any lens distortions, emulating the behavior of a pinhole camera. By carefully selecting the captured regions, it is possible to create a stereo pair using two VPCs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in both simulation using virtual environment and experiments using real cameras and their results compared to stereo cameras with parallel optical axes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of distortion removal and depth estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

A Flapping Wing Flying Robot (FWFR) can glide in favourable wind conditions, decreasing energy consumption significantly. In addition, it is also necessary to investigate the power consumption of the components in the flapping-wing robot. In this work, two sets of the FWFR components are analyzed in terms of power consumption: a) motor/electronics components and b) a vision system for monitoring the environment during the flight. A measurement device is used to record the power utilization of the motors in the launching and ascending phases of the flight and also in cruising flight around the desired height. Additionally, an analysis of event cameras and stereo vision systems in terms of energy consumption has been performed. The results provide a first step towards decreasing battery usage and, consequently, providing additional flight time.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods usually encode the 3D information of multi-view stereo into the 2D features. In contrast, we present a novel method, named POEM, that directly operates on the 3D POints Embedded in the Multi-view stereo for reconstructing hand mesh in it. Point is a natural form of 3D information and an ideal medium for fusing features across views, as it has different projections on different views. Our method is thus in light of a simple yet effective idea, that a complex 3D hand mesh can be represented by a set of 3D points that 1) are embedded in the multi-view stereo, 2) carry features from the multi-view images, and 3) encircle the hand. To leverage the power of points, we design two operations: point-based feature fusion and cross-set point attention mechanism. Evaluation on three challenging multi-view datasets shows that POEM outperforms the state-of-the-art in hand mesh reconstruction.

Our proposed solution is based on a newly-designed panoramic stereo camera along with a hybrid novel software framework that consists of three fusion modules. The panoramic stereo camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity maps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for the pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which effectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different nodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose graph. The refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory for volumetric fusion. In the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to produce the mesh of the whole garden. The proposed framework and its three fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the superiority of the performance.</p></details> | 32 pages | None |

While traditional methods for depth completion have relied on stereo vision or structured light techniques, recent advances in deep learning have enabled more accurate and efficient completion of depth maps from RGB images and sparse ToF measurements. To evaluate the performance of different depth completion methods, we organized an RGB+sparse ToF depth completion competition. The competition aimed to encourage research in this area by providing a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics to compare the accuracy of different approaches. In this report, we present the results of the competition and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the top-performing methods. We also discuss the implications of our findings for future research in RGB+sparse ToF depth completion. We hope that this competition and report will help to advance the state-of-the-art in this important area of research.

This study suggests a real-time overtaking assistance system that uses a combination of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm and stereo vision techniques to accurately identify and locate vehicles in front of the driver, and estimate their distance. The system then signals the vehicles behind the driver using colored lights to inform them of the safe overtaking distance. The proposed system has been implemented using Stereo vision for distance analysis and You Only Look Once (YOLO) for object identification. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in providing vehicle type and the distance between the camera module and the vehicle accurately with an approximate error of 4.107%. Our system has the potential to reduce the risk of accidents and improve the safety of overtaking maneuvers, especially on busy highways and roads.</p></details> |  | None |

The respectively used principle of measuring distances provides advantages and drawbacks. These are typically not compared nor discussed in the literature due to a lack of multi-modal datasets. Texture-less regions are problematic for structure from motion and stereo, reflective material poses issues for active sensing, and distances for translucent objects are intricate to measure with existing hardware. Training on inaccurate or corrupt data induces model bias and hampers generalisation capabilities. These effects remain unnoticed if the sensor measurement is considered as ground truth during the evaluation. This paper investigates the effect of sensor errors for the dense 3D vision tasks of depth estimation and reconstruction. We rigorously show the significant impact of sensor characteristics on the learned predictions and notice generalisation issues arising from various technologies in everyday household environments. For evaluation, we introduce a carefully designed dataset\footnote{dataset available at https://github.com/Junggy/HAMMER-dataset} comprising measurements from commodity sensors, namely D-ToF, I-ToF, passive/active stereo, and monocular RGB+P.

While deep neural networks have shown impressive results in computer vision, most of the previous obstacle detection works only leverage traditional stereo matching techniques to meet the computational constraints for real-time feedback. This paper proposes a computationally efficient method that employs a deep neural network to detect occupancy from stereo images directly. Instead of learning the point cloud correspondence from the stereo data, our approach extracts the compact obstacle distribution based on volumetric representations. In addition, we prune the computation of safety irrelevant spaces in a coarse-to-fine manner based on octrees generated by the decoder. As a result, we achieve real-time performance on the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson TX2). Our approach detects obstacles accurately in the range of 32 meters and achieves better IoU (Intersection over Union) and CD (Chamfer Distance) scores with only 2% of the computation cost of the state-of-the-art stereo model. Furthermore, we validate our method's robustness and real-world feasibility through autonomous navigation experiments with a real robot. Hence, our work contributes toward closing the gap between the stereo-based system in robot perception and state-of-the-art stereo models in computer vision. To counter the scarcity of high-quality real-world indoor stereo datasets, we collect a 1.36 hours stereo dataset with a mobile robot which is used to fine-tune our model.

| **[Stereo X-ray Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13207v1)** | 2023-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray tomography is a powerful volumetric imaging technique, but detailed three dimensional (3D) imaging requires the acquisition of a large number of individual X-ray images, which is time consuming. For applications where spatial information needs to be collected quickly, for example, when studying dynamic processes, standard X-ray tomography is therefore not applicable. Inspired by stereo vision, in this paper, we develop X-ray imaging methods that work with two X-ray projection images. In this setting, without the use of additional strong prior information, we no longer have enough information to fully recover the 3D tomographic images. However, up to a point, we are nevertheless able to extract spatial locations of point and line features. From stereo vision, it is well known that, for a known imaging geometry, once the same point is identified in two images taken from different directions, then the point's location in 3D space is exactly specified. The challenge is the matching of points between images. As X-ray transmission images are fundamentally different from the surface reflection images used in standard computer vision, we here develop a different feature identification and matching approach. In fact, once point like features are identified, if there are limited points in the image, then they can often be matched exactly. In fact, by utilising a third observation from an appropriate direction, matching becomes unique. Once matched, point locations in 3D space are easily computed using geometric considerations. Linear features, with clear end points, can be located using a similar approach.</p></details> |  | None |

With the advent of COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a need to fully automate ultrasound imaging as it requires trained operators in close proximity to patients for a long period of time, therefore increasing risk of infection.

We have collected underwater forward-looking stereo-vision and visual-inertial image sets in the Mediterranean and Red Sea. To our knowledge there are no other public datasets in the underwater environment acquired with this camera-sensor orientation published with ground-truth. These datasets are critical for the development of several underwater applications, including obstacle avoidance, visual odometry, 3D tracking, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and depth estimation. The stereo datasets include synchronized stereo images in dynamic underwater environments with objects of known-size. The visual-inertial datasets contain monocular images and IMU measurements, aligned with millisecond resolution timestamps and objects of known size which were placed in the scene. Both sensor configurations allow for scale estimation, with the calibrated baseline in the stereo setup and the IMU in the visual-inertial setup. Ground truth depth maps were created offline for both dataset types using photogrammetry. The ground truth is validated with multiple known measurements placed throughout the imaged environment. There are 5 stereo and 8 visual-inertial datasets in total, each containing thousands of images, with a range of different underwater visibility and ambient light conditions, natural and man-made structures and dynamic camera motions. The forward-looking orientation of the camera makes these datasets unique and ideal for testing underwater obstacle-avoidance algorithms and for navigation close to the seafloor in dynamic environments. With our datasets, we hope to encourage the advancement of autonomous functionality for underwater vehicles in dynamic and/or shallow water environments.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper discusses an unsupervised approach to rehabilitating patients who have temporary facial paralysis due to damage in mimetic muscles. The work aims to make the rehabilitation process objective compared to the current subjective approach, such as House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Also, the approach will assist clinicians by reducing their workload in assessing the improvement during rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the clustering approach to monitor the rehabilitation process. We compare the results obtained from different clustering algorithms on various forms of the same data set, namely dynamic form, data expressed as functional data using B-spline basis expansion, and by finding the functional principal components of the functional data. The study contains data set of 85 distinct patients with 120 measurements obtained using a Kinect stereo-vision camera. The method distinguish effectively between patients with the least and greatest degree of facial paralysis, however patients with adjacent degrees of paralysis provide some challenges.

| **[Vision-Based Environmental Perception for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11453v1)** | 2022-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual perception plays an important role in autonomous driving. One of the primary tasks is object detection and identification. Since the vision sensor is rich in color and texture information, it can quickly and accurately identify various road information. The commonly used technique is based on extracting and calculating various features of the image. The recent development of deep learning-based method has better reliability and processing speed and has a greater advantage in recognizing complex elements. For depth estimation, vision sensor is also used for ranging due to their small size and low cost. Monocular camera uses image data from a single viewpoint as input to estimate object depth. In contrast, stereo vision is based on parallax and matching feature points of different views, and the application of deep learning also further improves the accuracy. In addition, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) can establish a model of the road environment, thus helping the vehicle perceive the surrounding environment and complete the tasks. In this paper, we introduce and compare various methods of object detection and identification, then explain the development of depth estimation and compare various methods based on monocular, stereo, and RDBG sensors, next review and compare various methods of SLAM, and finally summarize the current problems and present the future development trends of vision technologies.</p></details> | 39 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Stereo Image Rain Removal via Dual-View Mutual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10104v2)** | 2022-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo images, containing left and right view images with disparity, are utilized in solving low-vision tasks recently, e.g., rain removal and super-resolution. Stereo image restoration methods usually obtain better performance than monocular methods by learning the disparity between dual views either implicitly or explicitly. However, existing stereo rain removal methods still cannot make full use of the complementary information between two views, and we find it is because: 1) the rain streaks have more complex distributions in directions and densities, which severely damage the complementary information and pose greater challenges; 2) the disparity estimation is not accurate enough due to the imperfect fusion mechanism for the features between two views. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new \underline{Stereo} \underline{I}mage \underline{R}ain \underline{R}emoval method (StereoIRR) via sufficient interaction between two views, which incorporates: 1) a new Dual-view Mutual Attention (DMA) mechanism which generates mutual attention maps by taking left and right views as key information for each other to facilitate cross-view feature fusion; 2) a long-range and cross-view interaction, which is constructed with basic blocks and dual-view mutual attention, can alleviate the adverse effect of rain on complementary information to help the features of stereo images to get long-range and cross-view interaction and fusion. Notably, StereoIRR outperforms other related monocular and stereo image rain removal methods on several datasets. Our codes and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these advantages, event cameras cannot be directly applied to computational imaging tasks due to the inability to obtain high-quality intensity and events simultaneously. This paper aims to connect a standalone event camera and a modern intensity camera so that the applications can take advantage of both two sensors. We establish this connection through a multi-modal stereo matching task. We first convert events to a reconstructed image and extend the existing stereo networks to this multi-modality condition. We propose a self-supervised method to train the multi-modal stereo network without using ground truth disparity data. The structure loss calculated on image gradients is used to enable self-supervised learning on such multi-modal data. Exploiting the internal stereo constraint between views with different modalities, we introduce general stereo loss functions, including disparity cross-consistency loss and internal disparity loss, leading to improved performance and robustness compared to existing approaches. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially the proposed general stereo loss functions, on both synthetic and real datasets. At last, we shed light on employing the aligned events and intensity images in downstream tasks, e.g., video interpolation application.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the Journal of Imaging Science & Technology</p></details> | None |

Our work is motivated by the robustness of Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) in computer vision and robotics, where a sparse and unevenly distributed set of feature points characterizes a scene. To improve stereo matching, we propose to elevate 2D hints to 3D points. These sparse and unevenly distributed 3D visual hints are expanded using a 3D random geometric graph, which enhances the learning and inference process. We evaluate our proposal on multiple widely adopted benchmarks and show improved performance without access to additional sensors other than the image sequence. To highlight practical applicability and symbiosis with visual odometry, we demonstrate how our methods run on embedded hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

The use of matching techniques and cost functions is crucial in the development of the disparity map. This paper presents a comparative study of six different stereo matching algorithms including Block Matching (BM), Block Matching with Dynamic Programming (BMDP), Belief Propagation (BP), Gradient Feature Matching (GF), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), and the proposed method. Also three cost functions namely Mean Squared Error (MSE), Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD), Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) were used and compared. The stereo images used in this study were from the Middlebury Stereo Datasets provided with perfect and imperfect calibrations. Results show that the selection of matching function is quite important and also depends on the images properties. Results showed that the BP algorithm in most cases provided better results getting accuracies over 95%.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, this report presents an improved RaftStereo trained with a mixed dataset of seven public datasets for the robust vision challenge (denoted as iRaftStereo_RVC). When evaluated on the training sets of Middlebury, KITTI-2015, and ETH3D, the model outperforms its counterparts trained with only one dataset, such as the popular Sceneflow.

However, existing methods struggles to generalize and predict reliably in hazardous regions, such as large uniform regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Context Enhanced Path (CEP). CEP improves the generalization and robustness against common failure cases in existing solutions by capturing the long-range global information. We construct our stereo depth estimation model, Context Enhanced Stereo Transformer (CSTR), by plugging CEP into the state-of-the-art stereo depth estimation method Stereo Transformer. CSTR is examined on distinct public datasets, such as Scene Flow, Middlebury-2014, KITTI-2015, and MPI-Sintel. We find CSTR outperforms prior approaches by a large margin. For example, in the zero-shot synthetic-to-real setting, CSTR outperforms the best competing approaches on Middlebury-2014 dataset by 11%. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the long-range information is critical for stereo matching task and CEP successfully captures such information.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2022 | None |

For estimating animal abundance using methods such as camera trap distance sampling, spatial information of natural habitats in terms of 3D (three-dimensional) measurements is crucial. Additionally, 3D information improves the accuracy of animal detection using camera trapping. This study presents a novel approach to 3D camera trapping featuring highly optimized hardware and software. This approach employs stereo vision to infer 3D information of natural habitats and is designated as StereO CameRA Trap for monitoring of biodivErSity (SOCRATES). A comprehensive evaluation of SOCRATES shows not only a $3.23\%$ improvement in animal detection (bounding box $\text{mAP}_{75}$) but also its superior applicability for estimating animal abundance using camera trap distance sampling.

Active stereo-based methods mitigate this problem by projecting a pseudo-random pattern on the scene so that each patch of an image pair can be identified without ambiguity. However, the projected pattern significantly alters the appearance of the image. If this pattern acts as a form of adversarial noise, it could negatively impact the performance of deep learning-based methods, which are now the de-facto standard for dense stereo vision. In this paper, we propose the Active-Passive SimStereo dataset and a corresponding benchmark to evaluate the performance gap between passive and active stereo images for stereo matching algorithms. Using the proposed benchmark and an additional ablation study, we show that the feature extraction and matching modules of a selection of twenty selected deep learning-based stereo matching methods generalize to active stereo without a problem. However, the disparity refinement modules of three of the twenty architectures (ACVNet, CascadeStereo, and StereoNet) are negatively affected by the active stereo patterns due to their reliance on the appearance of the input images.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, accepted in NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> | None |
| **[Bayesian Learning for Disparity Map Refinement for Semi-Dense Active Stereo Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05082v1)** | 2022-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major focus of recent developments in stereo vision has been on how to obtain accurate dense disparity maps in passive stereo vision. Active vision systems enable more accurate estimations of dense disparity compared to passive stereo. However, subpixel-accurate disparity estimation remains an open problem that has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a new learning strategy to train neural networks to estimate high-quality subpixel disparity maps for semi-dense active stereo vision. The key insight is that neural networks can double their accuracy if they are able to jointly learn how to refine the disparity map while invalidating the pixels where there is insufficient information to correct the disparity estimate. Our approach is based on Bayesian modeling where validated and invalidated pixels are defined by their stochastic properties, allowing the model to learn how to choose by itself which pixels are worth its attention. Using active stereo datasets such as Active-Passive SimStereo, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art active stereo models. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art passive stereo models on the Middlebury dataset.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures | None |

While various deep learning-based approaches have been developed for stereo, the input data from a binocular setup with a fixed baseline are limited. Addressing such a problem, we present an end-to-end network for processing the data from a trinocular setup, which is a combination of a narrow and a wide stereo pair. In this design, two pairs of binocular data with a common reference image are treated with shared weights of the network and a mid-level fusion. We also propose a Guided Addition method for merging the 4D data of the two baselines. Additionally, an iterative sequential self-supervised and supervised learning on real and synthetic datasets is presented, making the training of the trinocular system practical with no need to ground-truth data of the real dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the trinocular disparity network surpasses the scenario where individual pairs are fed into a similar architecture.

Despite the surge, the use of the transformer for the problem of stereo matching remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the use of the transformer for the problem of stereo matching, especially for laparoscopic videos, and propose a new hybrid deep stereo matching framework (HybridStereoNet) that combines the best of the CNN and the transformer in a unified design. To be specific, we investigate several ways to introduce transformers to volumetric stereo matching pipelines by analyzing the loss landscape of the designs and in-domain/cross-domain accuracy. Our analysis suggests that employing transformers for feature representation learning, while using CNNs for cost aggregation will lead to faster convergence, higher accuracy and better generalization than other options.

An informative and concise cost volume representation is vital for stereo matching of high accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel cost volume construction method which generates attention weights from correlation clues to suppress redundant information and enhance matching-related information in the concatenation volume. To generate reliable attention weights, we propose multi-level adaptive patch matching to improve the distinctiveness of the matching cost at different disparities even for textureless regions. The proposed cost volume is named attention concatenation volume (ACV) which can be seamlessly embedded into most stereo matching networks, the resulting networks can use a more lightweight aggregation network and meanwhile achieve higher accuracy, e.g. using only 1/25 parameters of the aggregation network can achieve higher accuracy for GwcNet.

Robotic applications require real time depth estimation for navigation and decision making under rapidly changing 3D surroundings. A high accuracy algorithm may provide the best depth estimation but may consume tremendous compute and energy resources. A general trade-off is to choose less accurate methods for initial depth estimate and a more accurate yet compute intensive method when needed. Previous work has shown this trade-off can be improved by developing a state-of-the-art method (AnyNet) to improve stereo depth estimation. We studied both the monocular and stereo vision depth estimation methods and investigated methods to reduce computational complexity of these methods. This was our baseline. Consequently, our experiments show reduction of monocular depth estimation model size by ~75% reduces accuracy by less than 2% (SSIM metric). Our experiments with the novel stereo vision method (AnyNet) show that accuracy of depth estimation does not degrade more than 3% (three pixel error metric) in spite of reduction in model size by ~20%. We have shown that smaller models can indeed perform competitively.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose CER-MVS (Cascaded Epipolar RAFT Multiview Stereo), a new approach based on the RAFT (Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms) architecture developed for optical flow. CER-MVS introduces five new changes to RAFT: epipolar cost volumes, cost volume cascading, multiview fusion of cost volumes, dynamic supervision, and multiresolution fusion of depth maps. CER-MVS is significantly different from prior work in multiview stereo. Unlike prior work, which operates by updating a 3D cost volume, CER-MVS operates by updating a disparity field. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive thresholding method to balance the completeness and accuracy of the reconstructed point clouds. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance on DTU (the second best among known results) and state-of-the-art performance on the Tanks-and-Temples benchmark (both the intermediate and advanced set).

However, their quadratic computational complexity poses a major obstacle for applying them to vision tasks requiring dense predictions, such as object detection, feature matching, stereo, etc. We introduce QuadTree Attention, which reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Our quadtree transformer builds token pyramids and computes attention in a coarse-to-fine manner. At each level, the top K patches with the highest attention scores are selected, such that at the next level, attention is only evaluated within the relevant regions corresponding to these top K patches. We demonstrate that quadtree attention achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, e.g. with 4.0% improvement in feature matching on ScanNet, about 50% flops reduction in stereo matching, 0.4-1.5% improvement in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, 1.2-1.8% improvement on COCO object detection, and 0.7-2.4% improvement on semantic segmentation over previous state-of-the-art transformers.

However, the lack of 3D spatial perception limits situational awareness during procedures and hinders mastering surgical skills in the narrow abdominal space. Depth estimation, as a representative perception task, is typically defined as an image reconstruction problem. In this work, we show that depth estimation can be reformed from a 3D surface perspective. We propose a loss function for depth estimation that integrates the surface-aware constraints, leading to a faster and better convergence with the valid information from spatial information. In addition, camera parameters are incorporated into the training pipeline to increase the control and transparency of the depth estimation. We also integrate a specularity removal module to recover more buried image information. Quantitative experimental results on endoscopic datasets and user studies with medical professionals demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach to safety-critical control. In particular, the uncertainty associated with stereo vision is estimated, and adapted online to new visual environments, wherein this estimate is leveraged in a safety-critical controller in a robust fashion. To this end, we propose an algorithm that exploits the structure of stereo-vision to learn an uncertainty estimate without the need for ground-truth data. We then robustify existing Control Barrier Function-based controllers to provide safety in the presence of this uncertainty estimate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a quadrupedal robot in a variety of environments. When not using our method safety is violated. With offline training alone we observe the robot is safe, but overly-conservative.

Existing methods mainly focus on simple disparity map fusion to improve stereo matching, which require multiple dense or sparse disparity maps. In this paper, we propose a simple yet novel scheme, termed feature disparity propagation, to improve general stereo matching based on matching cost volume and sparse matching feature points. Specifically, our scheme first calculates a reliable sparse disparity map by local feature matching, and then refines the disparity map by propagating reliable disparities to neighboring pixels in the matching cost domain. In addition, considering the gradient and multi-scale information of local disparity regions, we present a $\rho$-Census cost measure based on the well-known AD-Census, which guarantees the robustness of cost volume even without the cost aggregation step. Extensive experiments on Middlebury stereo benchmark V3 demonstrate that our scheme achieves promising performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We used a semi-automatic way to construct the dataset: after camera calibration and image registration, high accuracy disparity images can be obtained from the depth images. In total, PlantStereo contains 812 image pairs covering a diverse set of plants: spinach, tomato, pepper and pumpkin. We firstly evaluated our PlantStereo dataset on four different stereo matching methods. Extensive experiments on different models and plants show that compared with ground truth in integer accuracy, high accuracy disparity images provided by PlantStereo can remarkably improve the training effect of deep learning models. This paper provided a feasible and reliable method to realize plant surface dense reconstruction.

| **[A Large RGB-D Dataset for Semi-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10230v2)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current self-supervised methods for monocular depth estimation are largely based on deeply nested convolutional networks that leverage stereo image pairs or monocular sequences during a training phase. However, they often exhibit inaccurate results around occluded regions and depth boundaries. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for monocular depth estimation using stereo image pairs. The study aims to propose a student-teacher strategy in which a shallow student network is trained with the auxiliary information obtained from a deeper and more accurate teacher network. Specifically, we first train the stereo teacher network by fully utilizing the binocular perception of 3-D geometry and then use the depth predictions of the teacher network to train the student network for monocular depth inference. This enables us to exploit all available depth data from massive unlabeled stereo pairs. We propose a strategy that involves the use of a data ensemble to merge the multiple depth predictions of the teacher network to improve the training samples by collecting non-trivial knowledge beyond a single prediction. To refine the inaccurate depth estimation that is used when training the student network, we further propose stereo confidence-guided regression loss that handles the unreliable pseudo depth values in occlusion, texture-less region, and repetitive pattern. To complement the existing dataset comprising outdoor driving scenes, we built a novel large-scale dataset consisting of one million outdoor stereo images taken using hand-held stereo cameras. Finally, we demonstrate that the monocular depth estimation network provides feature representations that are suitable for high-level vision tasks. The experimental results for various outdoor scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://dimlrgbd.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a new framework, called CycleMPI, that is capable of learning a multiplane image representation from single images through a cyclic training strategy for self-supervision. Our framework does not require stereo data for training, therefore it can be trained with massive visual data from the Internet, resulting in a better generalization capability even for very challenging cases. Although our method does not require stereo data for supervision, it reaches results on stereo datasets comparable to the state of the art in a zero-shot scenario. We evaluated our method on RealEstate10K and Mannequin Challenge datasets for view synthesis and presented qualitative results on Places II dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on BMVC 2021</p></details> | None |
| **[DoubleStar: Long-Range Attack Towards Depth Estimation based Obstacle Avoidance in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03154v1)** | 2021-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation-based obstacle avoidance has been widely adopted by autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It normally relies on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and make flying/driving decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the obstacle in the path or moving away from the detected obstacle. In this paper, we explore new security risks associated with the stereo vision-based depth estimation algorithms used for obstacle avoidance. By exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in depth estimation algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we propose DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by projecting pure light from two complementary light sources. DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs respectively to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two commercial stereo cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel RealSense). The visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras illustrates the false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use Ardupilot to simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To validate the attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards a commercial drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance algorithms. Our attack can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden stop or drift it away across a long distance under various lighting conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion mechanisms. Specifically, our experimental results show that DoubleStar creates fake depth up to 15 meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the daytime. To mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on potential countermeasures to defend against DoubleStar.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stereo Video Reconstruction Without Explicit Depth Maps for Endoscopic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08227v1)** | 2021-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of stereo video reconstruction or, equivalently, 2D-to-3D video conversion for minimally invasive surgical video. We design and implement a series of end-to-end U-Net-based solutions for this task by varying the input (single frame vs. multiple consecutive frames), loss function (MSE, MAE, or perceptual losses), and network architecture. We evaluate these solutions by surveying ten experts - surgeons who routinely perform endoscopic surgery. We run two separate reader studies: one evaluating individual frames and the other evaluating fully reconstructed 3D video played on a VR headset. In the first reader study, a variant of the U-Net that takes as input multiple consecutive video frames and outputs the missing view performs best. We draw two conclusions from this outcome. First, motion information coming from multiple past frames is crucial in recreating stereo vision. Second, the proposed U-Net variant can indeed exploit such motion information for solving this task. The result from the second study further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed U-Net variant. The surgeons reported that they could successfully perceive depth from the reconstructed 3D video clips. They also expressed a clear preference for the reconstructed 3D video over the original 2D video. These two reader studies strongly support the usefulness of the proposed task of stereo reconstruction for minimally invasive surgical video and indicate that deep learning is a promising approach to this task. Finally, we identify two automatic metrics, LPIPS and DISTS, that are strongly correlated with expert judgement and that could serve as proxies for the latter in future studies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Level Set Binocular Stereo with Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03464v1)** | 2021-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing stereo boundaries and predicting nearby disparities are difficult because stereo boundaries induce occluded regions where matching cues are absent. Most modern computer vision algorithms treat occlusions secondarily (e.g., via left-right consistency checks after matching) or rely on high-level cues to improve nearby disparities (e.g., via deep networks and large training sets). They ignore the geometry of stereo occlusions, which dictates that the spatial extent of occlusion must equal the amplitude of the disparity jump that causes it. This paper introduces an energy and level-set optimizer that improves boundaries by encoding occlusion geometry. Our model applies to two-layer, figure-ground scenes, and it can be implemented cooperatively using messages that pass predominantly between parents and children in an undecimated hierarchy of multi-scale image patches. In a small collection of figure-ground scenes curated from Middlebury and Falling Things stereo datasets, our model provides more accurate boundaries than previous occlusion-handling stereo techniques. This suggests new directions for creating cooperative stereo systems that incorporate occlusion cues in a human-like manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended journal version of arXiv:2006.16094</p></details> | None |

The former approaches typically employ 2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation algorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated dataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods were the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based methods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo vision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity transformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be highly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for state-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or transformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the SoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for road pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by graph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph attention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to optimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our experiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with nine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity images, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that our proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection accuracy on all training data modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a regular paper to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |

Due to the high cost of commonly used LiDAR sensor, stereo vision based 3D detection, as an economical yet effective setting, attracts more attention recently. For these approaches based on 2D images, accurate depth information is the key to achieve 3D detection, and most existing methods resort to a preliminary stage for depth estimation. They mainly focus on the global depth and neglect the property of depth information in this specific task, namely, sparsity and locality, where exactly accurate depth is only needed for these 3D bounding boxes. Motivated by this finding, we propose a stereo-image based anchor-free 3D detection method, called structure-aware stereo 3D detector (termed as SIDE), where we explore the instance-level depth information via constructing the cost volume from RoIs of each object. Due to the information sparsity of local cost volume, we further introduce match reweighting and structure-aware attention, to make the depth information more concentrated. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods without depth map supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by WACV 2022</p></details> | None |

This gain, however, is attained with a high increase in computation cost, such that the network may not fit even on a moderate GPU. This issue raises problems when the model needs to be deployed on resource-limited devices. For this, we propose two light models for stereo vision with reduced complexity and without sacrificing accuracy. Depending on the dimension of cost volume, we design a 2D and a 3D model with encoder-decoders built from 2D and 3D convolutions, respectively. To this end, we leverage 2D MobileNet blocks and extend them to 3D for stereo vision application. Besides, a new cost volume is proposed to boost the accuracy of the 2D model, making it performing close to 3D networks. Experiments show that the proposed 2D/3D networks effectively reduce the computational expense (27%/95% and 72%/38% fewer parameters/operations in 2D and 3D models, respectively) while upholding the accuracy.

Unlike multi-view stereo with images captured at unconstrained camera poses, the proposed system controls the motion of a camera to capture a sequence of images in horizontally or vertically aligned positions with the same parallax. In this system, we propose a new heuristic method and a robust learning-based method to fuse multiple cost volumes between the reference image and its surrounding images. To obtain training data, we build a synthetic dataset with multiscopic images.

| **[Object Disparity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07939v1)** | 2021-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of stereo vision works are focusing on computing the dense pixel disparity of a given pair of left and right images. A camera pair usually required lens undistortion and stereo calibration to provide an undistorted epipolar line calibrated image pair for accurate dense pixel disparity computation. Due to noise, object occlusion, repetitive or lack of texture and limitation of matching algorithms, the pixel disparity accuracy usually suffers the most at those object boundary areas. Although statistically the total number of pixel disparity errors might be low (under 2% according to the Kitti Vision Benchmark of current top ranking algorithms), the percentage of these disparity errors at object boundaries are very high. This renders the subsequence 3D object distance detection with much lower accuracy than desired. This paper proposed a different approach for solving a 3D object distance detection by detecting object disparity directly without going through a dense pixel disparity computation. An example squeezenet Object Disparity-SSD (OD-SSD) was constructed to demonstrate an efficient object disparity detection with comparable accuracy compared with Kitti dataset pixel disparity ground truth. Further training and testing results with mixed image dataset captured by several different stereo systems may suggest that an OD-SSD might be agnostic to stereo system parameters such as a baseline, FOV, lens distortion, even left/right camera epipolar line misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

The benefits of no need for ground-truth depth, online fine-tuning, and better generalization with unlimited data attract researchers to seek self-supervised solutions. In this work, we propose a new self-supervised framework for stereo matching utilizing multiple images captured at aligned camera positions. A cross photometric loss, an uncertainty-aware mutual-supervision loss, and a new smoothness loss are introduced to optimize the network in learning disparity maps end-to-end without ground-truth depth information. To train this framework, we build a new multiscopic dataset consisting of synthetic images rendered by 3D engines and real images captured by real cameras. After being trained with only the synthetic images, our network can perform well in unseen outdoor scenes. Our experiment shows that our model obtains better disparity maps than previous unsupervised methods on the KITTI dataset and is comparable to supervised methods when generalized to unseen data.

Most recent waterdrop removal approaches take a single image as input and often fail to recover the missing content behind waterdrops faithfully. Thus, we propose a learning-based model for waterdrop removal with stereo images. To better detect and remove waterdrops from stereo images, we propose a novel row-wise dilated attention module to enlarge attention's receptive field for effective information propagation between the two stereo images. In addition, we propose an attention consistency loss between the ground-truth disparity map and attention scores to enhance the left-right consistency in stereo images. Because of related datasets' unavailability, we collect a real-world dataset that contains stereo images with and without waterdrops. Extensive experiments on our dataset suggest that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Accelerating Markov Random Field Inference with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00570v1)** | 2021-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical machine learning has widespread application in various domains. These methods include probabilistic algorithms, such as Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC), which rely on generating random numbers from probability distributions. These algorithms are computationally expensive on conventional processors, yet their statistical properties, namely interpretability and uncertainty quantification (UQ) compared to deep learning, make them an attractive alternative approach. Therefore, hardware specialization can be adopted to address the shortcomings of conventional processors in running these applications. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput accelerator for Markov Random Field (MRF) inference, a powerful model for representing a wide range of applications, using MCMC with Gibbs sampling. We propose a tiled architecture which takes advantage of near-memory computing, and memory optimizations tailored to the semantics of MRF. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid on-chip/off-chip memory system and logging scheme to efficiently support UQ. This memory system design is not specific to MRF models and is applicable to applications using probabilistic algorithms. In addition, it dramatically reduces off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. We implemented an FPGA prototype of our proposed architecture using high-level synthesis tools and achieved 146MHz frequency for an accelerator with 32 function units on an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. Compared to prior work on FPGA, our accelerator achieves 26X speedup. Furthermore, our proposed memory system and logging scheme to support UQ reduces off-chip bandwidth by 71% for two applications. ASIC analysis in 15nm shows our design with 2048 function units running at 3GHz outperforms GPU implementations of motion estimation and stereo vision on Nvidia RTX2080Ti by 120X-210X, occupying only 7.7% of the area.</p></details> |  | None |

Thus, they are used in many fields such as robotics or biomedical applications but are primarily implemented through classical approaches, which require lots of heuristics and parameter tuning for reliable performance under different environments. In this work, we propose MarkerPose, a robust, real-time pose estimation system based on a planar target of three circles and a stereo vision system. MarkerPose is meant for high-accuracy pose estimation applications. Our method consists of two deep neural networks for marker point detection. A SuperPoint-like network for pixel-level accuracy keypoint localization and classification, and we introduce EllipSegNet, a lightweight ellipse segmentation network for sub-pixel-level accuracy keypoint detection. The marker's pose is estimated through stereo triangulation. The target point detection is robust to low lighting and motion blur conditions. We compared MarkerPose with a detection method based on classical computer vision techniques using a robotic arm for validation. The results show our method provides better accuracy than the classical technique. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of MarkerPose in a 3D freehand ultrasound system, which is an application where highly accurate pose estimation is required.

Taking images in the rain however often results in degraded quality of images, thus compromises the performance of many computer vision systems. Most existing de-rain algorithms use only one single input image and aim to recover a clean image. Few work has exploited stereo images. Moreover, even for single image based monocular deraining, many current methods fail to complete the task satisfactorily because they mostly rely on per pixel loss functions and ignore semantic information. In this paper, we present a Paired Rain Removal Network (PRRNet), which exploits both stereo images and semantic information. Specifically, we develop a Semantic-Aware Deraining Module (SADM) which solves both tasks of semantic segmentation and deraining of scenes, and a Semantic-Fusion Network (SFNet) and a View-Fusion Network (VFNet) which fuse semantic information and multi-view information respectively. In addition, we also introduce an Enhanced Paired Rain Removal Network (EPRRNet) which exploits semantic prior to remove rain streaks from stereo images. We first use a coarse deraining network to reduce the rain streaks on the input images, and then adopt a pre-trained semantic segmentation network to extract semantic features from the coarse derained image. Finally, a parallel stereo deraining network fuses semantic and multi-view information to restore finer results. We also propose new stereo based rainy datasets for benchmarking. Experiments on both monocular and the newly proposed stereo rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the difficulty in acquiring accurate and scalable ground truth data, the training of fully supervised methods is challenging. As an alternative, self-supervised methods are becoming more popular to mitigate this challenge. In this paper, we introduce the H-Net, a deep-learning framework for unsupervised stereo depth estimation that leverages epipolar geometry to refine stereo matching. For the first time, a Siamese autoencoder architecture is used for depth estimation which allows mutual information between the rectified stereo images to be extracted. To enforce the epipolar constraint, the mutual epipolar attention mechanism has been designed which gives more emphasis to correspondences of features which lie on the same epipolar line while learning mutual information between the input stereo pair. Stereo correspondences are further enhanced by incorporating semantic information to the proposed attention mechanism. More specifically, the optimal transport algorithm is used to suppress attention and eliminate outliers in areas not visible in both cameras. Extensive experiments on KITTI2015 and Cityscapes show that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art unsupervised stereo depth estimation methods while closing the gap with the fully supervised approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, it remains the computational bottleneck for classical machine vision approaches. By exploiting the properties of event cameras, recently proposed Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architectures for stereo vision have the potential of simplifying the stereo-matching problem. Several solutions that combine event cameras with spike-based neuromorphic processors already exist. However, they are either simulated on digital hardware or tested on simplified stimuli. In this work, we use the Dynamic Vision Sensor 3D Human Pose Dataset (DHP19) to validate a brain-inspired event-based stereo-matching architecture implemented on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor with real-world data. Our experiments show that this SNN architecture, composed of coincidence detectors and disparity sensitive neurons, is able to provide a coarse estimate of the input disparity instantaneously, thereby detecting the presence of a stimulus moving in depth in real-time.</p></details> |  | None |

Throughout the years the paradigm has shifted from local, pixel-level decision to various forms of discrete and continuous optimization to data-driven, learning-based methods. Recently, the rise of machine learning and the rapid proliferation of deep learning enhanced stereo matching with new exciting trends and applications unthinkable until a few years ago. Interestingly, the relationship between these two worlds is two-way. While machine, and especially deep, learning advanced the state-of-the-art in stereo matching, stereo itself enabled new ground-breaking methodologies such as self-supervised monocular depth estimation based on deep networks. In this paper, we review recent research in the field of learning-based depth estimation from single and binocular images highlighting the synergies, the successes achieved so far and the open challenges the community is going to face in the immediate future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TPAMI.

Compared to the monocular vision which usually does not explicitly introduce any geometrical constraint, stereo vision-based schemes are more promising and robust to produce accurate geometrical information, such as surface normal and depth/disparity. Besides, deep learning models trained with large-scale datasets have shown their superior performance in many stereo vision tasks. However, existing stereo datasets rarely contain the high-quality surface normal and disparity ground truth, which hardly satisfies the demand of training a prospective deep model for indoor scenes. To this end, we introduce a large-scale synthetic but naturalistic indoor robotics stereo (IRS) dataset with over 100K stereo RGB images and high-quality surface normal and disparity maps. Leveraging the advanced rendering techniques of our customized rendering engine, the dataset is considerably close to the real-world captured images and covers several visual effects, such as brightness changes, light reflection/transmission, lens flare, vivid shadow, etc. We compare the data distribution of IRS with existing stereo datasets to illustrate the typical visual attributes of indoor scenes. Besides, we present DTN-Net, a two-stage deep model for surface normal estimation. Extensive experiments show the advantages and effectiveness of IRS in training deep models for disparity estimation, and DTN-Net provides state-of-the-art results for normal estimation compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they are usually developed independently and have their respective strengths and limitations. We propose a novel unified learning framework that leverages the strengths of both monocular and stereo cues for 3D human localization. Our method jointly (i) associates humans in left-right images, (ii) deals with occluded and distant cases in stereo settings by relying on the robustness of monocular cues, and (iii) tackles the intrinsic ambiguity of monocular perspective projection by exploiting prior knowledge of the human height distribution. We specifically evaluate outliers as well as challenging instances, such as occluded and far-away pedestrians, by analyzing the entire error distribution and by estimating calibrated confidence intervals. Finally, we critically review the official KITTI 3D metrics and propose a practical 3D localization metric tailored for humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2021</p></details> | None |

Nowadays, most of the best-performing frameworks for stereo 3D object detection are based on dense depth reconstruction from disparity estimation, making them extremely computationally expensive. To enable real-world deployments of vision detection with binocular images, we take a step back to gain insights from 2D image-based detection frameworks and enhance them with stereo features. We incorporate knowledge and the inference structure from real-time one-stage 2D/3D object detector and introduce a light-weight stereo matching module. Our proposed framework, YOLOStereo3D, is trained on one single GPU and runs at more than ten fps.

The state-of-the-art algorithms are typically based on supervised learning. The performance of such approaches is always dependent on the quality and amount of labeled training data. Additionally, it remains an open challenge to train deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) using only a small quantity of training samples. Therefore, this paper mainly explores an effective training data augmentation approach that can be employed to improve the overall DCNN performance, when additional images captured from different views are available. Due to the fact that the pixels of the collision-free space (generally regarded as a planar surface) between two images captured from different views can be associated by a homography matrix, the scenario of the target image can be transformed into the reference view. This provides a simple but effective way of generating training data from additional multi-view images. Extensive experimental results, conducted with six state-of-the-art semantic segmentation DCNNs on three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed training data augmentation algorithm for enhancing collision-free space detection performance. When validated on the KITTI road benchmark, our approach provides the best results for stereo vision-based collision-free space detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</p></details> | None |

The matched disparity map can be calculated according to the camera imaging model to obtain a depth map, and then the depth map is converted to a point cloud image to obtain spatial point coordinates, thereby achieving the purpose of ranging. However, due to the influence of illumination under water, the captured images no longer meet the epipolar constraints, and the changes in imaging models make traditional calibration methods no longer applicable. Therefore, this paper proposes a new underwater real-time calibration method and a matching method based on the best search domain to improve the accuracy of underwater distance measurement using binoculars.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-synthesis: A fast way to produce effective datasets for stereo matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10811v1)** | 2021-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching is an important problem in computer vision which has drawn tremendous research attention for decades. Recent years, data-driven methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are continuously pushing stereo matching to new heights. However, data-driven methods require large amount of training data, which is not an easy task for real stereo data due to the annotation difficulties of per-pixel ground-truth disparity. Though synthetic dataset is proposed to fill the gaps of large data demand, the fine-tuning on real dataset is still needed due to the domain variances between synthetic data and real data. In this paper, we found that in synthetic datasets, close-to-real-scene texture rendering is a key factor to boost up stereo matching performance, while close-to-real-scene 3D modeling is less important. We then propose semi-synthetic, an effective and fast way to synthesize large amount of data with close-to-real-scene texture to minimize the gap between synthetic data and real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our proposed semi-synthetic datasets achieve significantly better performance than with general synthetic datasets, especially on real data benchmarks with limited training data. With further fine-tuning on the real dataset, we also achieve SOTA performance on Middlebury and competitive results on KITTI and ETH3D datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the most commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.</p></details> |  | None |

It has been assumed that the brain uses sparse coding to exploit statistical properties of the sensory stream. We hypothesize that sparse coding discovers patterns from the data set, which can be used to estimate a set of stimulus parameters by simple readout. In this study, we chose a model of stereo vision to test our hypothesis. We used the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), followed by a na\"ive Bayes classifier, to infer stereo disparity. From the results we report three observations. First, disparity inference was successful with this naturalistic processing pipeline. Second, an expanded, highly redundant representation is required to robustly identify the input patterns. Third, the inference error can be predicted from the number of active coefficients in the LCA representation. We conclude that sparse coding can generate a suitable general representation for subsequent inference tasks.

With the use of tiny but full-feature embedded supercomputers, computer stereo vision has been prevalently applied in autonomous cars for depth perception. The two key aspects of computer stereo vision are speed and accuracy. They are both desirable but conflicting properties, as the algorithms with better disparity accuracy usually have higher computational complexity. Therefore, the main aim of developing a computer stereo vision algorithm for resource-limited hardware is to improve the trade-off between speed and accuracy. In this chapter, we introduce both the hardware and software aspects of computer stereo vision for autonomous car systems. Then, we discuss four autonomous car perception tasks, including 1) visual feature detection, description and matching, 2) 3D information acquisition, 3) object detection/recognition and 4) semantic image segmentation. The principles of computer stereo vision and parallel computing on multi-threading CPU and GPU architectures are then detailed.</p></details> | Book chapter | None |

Despite being highly advanced, existing solutions based on RGB, RGB-D and Lidar sensors are power and data intensive, which introduces challenges for deployment in edge devices. We approach 3D reconstruction with an event camera, a sensor with significantly lower power, latency and data expense while enabling high dynamic range. While previous event-based 3D reconstruction methods are primarily based on stereo vision, we cast the problem as multi-view shape from silhouette using a monocular event camera. The output from a moving event camera is a sparse point set of space-time gradients, largely sketching scene/object edges and contours. We first introduce an event-to-silhouette (E2S) neural network module to transform a stack of event frames to the corresponding silhouettes, with additional neural branches for camera pose regression. Second, we introduce E3D, which employs a 3D differentiable renderer (PyTorch3D) to enforce cross-view 3D mesh consistency and fine-tune the E2S and pose network. Lastly, we introduce a 3D-to-events simulation pipeline and apply it to publicly available object datasets and generate synthetic event/silhouette training pairs for supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Correct author names and only include primary author email</p></details> | None |

Although self-supervised learning has recently spread across many computer vision tasks, it has been barely considered in the field of confidence estimation. In this paper, we propose a flexible and lightweight solution enabling self-adapting confidence estimation agnostic to the stereo algorithm or network. Our approach relies on the minimum information available in any stereo setup (i.e., the input stereo pair and the output disparity map) to learn an effective confidence measure. This strategy allows us not only a seamless integration with any stereo system, including consumer and industrial devices equipped with undisclosed stereo perception methods, but also, due to its self-adapting capability, for its out-of-the-box deployment in the field. Exhaustive experimental results with different standard datasets support our claims, showing how our solution is the first-ever enabling online learning of accurate confidence estimation for any stereo system and without any requirement for the end-user.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2020 (errata corrige: eq.6, k domain)</p></details> | None |

Recently, stereo network based on coarse-to-fine method has largely relieved the memory constraints and speed limitations of large-scale network models. Nevertheless, all of the previous coarse-to-fine designs employ constant offsets and three or more stages to progressively refine the coarse disparity map, still resulting in unsatisfactory computation accuracy and inference time when deployed on mobile devices. This paper claims that the coarse matching errors can be corrected efficiently with fewer stages as long as more accurate disparity candidates can be provided. Therefore, we propose a dynamic offset prediction module to meet different correction requirements of diverse objects and design an efficient two-stage framework. Besides, we propose a disparity-independent convolution to further improve the performance since it is more consistent with the local statistical characteristics of the compact cost volume. The evaluation results on multiple datasets and platforms clearly demonstrate that, the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art lightweight models especially for mobile devices in terms of accuracy and speed.

| **[Adjusting Bias in Long Range Stereo Matching: A semantics guided approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04629v2)** | 2020-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo vision generally involves the computation of pixel correspondences and estimation of disparities between rectified image pairs. In many applications, including simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and 3D object detection, the disparities are primarily needed to calculate depth values and the accuracy of depth estimation is often more compelling than disparity estimation. The accuracy of disparity estimation, however, does not directly translate to the accuracy of depth estimation, especially for faraway objects. In the context of learning-based stereo systems, this is largely due to biases imposed by the choices of the disparity-based loss function and the training data. Consequently, the learning algorithms often produce unreliable depth estimates of foreground objects, particularly at large distances~($>50$m). To resolve this issue, we first analyze the effect of those biases and then propose a pair of novel depth-based loss functions for foreground and background, separately. These loss functions are tunable and can balance the inherent bias of the stereo learning algorithms. The efficacy of our solution is demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments, which are benchmarked against state of the art. We show on KITTI~2015 benchmark that our proposed solution yields substantial improvements in disparity and depth estimation, particularly for objects located at distances beyond 50 meters, outperforming the previous state of the art by $10\%$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |

Stereo-cameras have struck the perfect balance of weight and accuracy of depth estimation but suffer from the problem of depth range being limited and dictated by the baseline chosen at design time. In this paper, we present a framework for quadrotor navigation based on a stereo camera system whose baseline can be adapted on-the-fly. We present a method to calibrate the system at a small number of discrete baselines and interpolate the parameters for the entire baseline range. We present an extensive theoretical analysis of calibration and synchronization errors. We showcase three different applications of such a system for quadrotor navigation: (a) flying through a forest, (b) flying through an unknown shaped/location static/dynamic gap, and (c) accurate 3D pose detection of an independently moving object. We show that our variable baseline system is more accurate and robust in all three scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work that applies the concept of morphable design to achieve a variable baseline stereo vision system on a quadrotor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

The underlying idea for the NAS algorithm is straightforward, namely, to enable the network the ability to choose among a set of operations (e.g., convolution with different filter sizes), one is able to find an optimal architecture that is better adapted to the problem at hand. However, so far the success of NAS has not been enjoyed by low-level geometric vision tasks such as stereo matching. This is partly due to the fact that state-of-the-art deep stereo matching networks, designed by humans, are already sheer in size. Directly applying the NAS to such massive structures is computationally prohibitive based on the currently available mainstream computing resources. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end hierarchical NAS framework for deep stereo matching by incorporating task-specific human knowledge into the neural architecture search framework. Specifically, following the gold standard pipeline for deep stereo matching (i.e., feature extraction -- feature volume construction and dense matching), we optimize the architectures of the entire pipeline jointly. Extensive experiments show that our searched network outperforms all state-of-the-art deep stereo matching architectures and is ranked at the top 1 accuracy on KITTI stereo 2012, 2015 and Middlebury benchmarks, as well as the top 1 on SceneFlow dataset with a substantial improvement on the size of the network and the speed of inference.

From LIDAR sensors in autonomous cars and drones to the time of flight and stereo vision systems in our phones, point clouds are everywhere. Despite their ubiquity, point clouds in the real world are often missing points because of sensor limitations or occlusions, or contain extraneous points from sensor noise or artifacts. These problems challenge algorithms that require computing correspondences between a pair of point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a fully-convolutional neural network that identifies which points in one point cloud are most similar (inliers) to the points in another. We show improvements in learning-based and classical point cloud registration approaches when retrofitted with our network. We demonstrate these improvements on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Deep learning based approaches have recently demonstrated impressive reconstruction results. When training such models, self-supervised methods are favourable since they do not rely on ground truth data which would be needed for supervised training and is often difficult to obtain. Moreover, learned multi-view stereo reconstruction is prone to environment changes and should robustly generalise to different domains. We propose an adaptive learning approach for multi-view stereo which trains a deep neural network for improved adaptability to new target domains. We use model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to train base parameters which, in turn, are adapted for multi-view stereo on new domains through self-supervised training.

However, large datasets of diverse real-world scenes with dense ground truth are difficult to obtain and currently not publicly available to the research community. As a result, many algorithms rely on small real-world datasets of similar scenes or synthetic datasets, but end-to-end algorithms trained on such datasets often generalize poorly to different images that arise in real-world applications. As a step towards addressing this problem, we propose to incorporate prior knowledge of scene geometry into an end-to-end stereo network to help networks generalize better. For a given network, we explicitly add a gradient-domain smoothness prior and occlusion reasoning into the network training, while the architecture remains unchanged during inference. Experimentally, we show consistent improvements if we train on synthetic datasets and test on the Middlebury (real images) dataset. Noticeably, we improve PSM-Net accuracy on Middlebury from 5.37 MAE to 3.21 MAE without sacrificing speed.</p></details> |  | None |

In computer vision, the two problems are traditionally solved in separate tracks. In this paper, we present a unified learning-based technique that simultaneously uses both types of cues for depth inference. Specifically, we use a pair of focal stacks as input to emulate human perception. We first construct a comprehensive focal stack training dataset synthesized by depth-guided light field rendering. We then construct three individual networks: a Focus-Net to extract depth from a single focal stack, a EDoF-Net to obtain the extended depth of field (EDoF) image from the focal stack, and a Stereo-Net to conduct stereo matching. We show how to integrate them into a unified BDfF-Net to obtain high-quality depth maps. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both accuracy and speed and effectively emulates human vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We argue that the challenges of removing this gap are significant, owing to fundamental limitations of monocular vision. As a result, we focus our efforts on depth estimation by stereo. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach to training a deep stereo neural network, along with a novel architecture containing a machine-learned argmax layer and a custom runtime (that will be shared publicly) that enables a smaller version of our stereo DNN to run on an embedded GPU.

Meanwhile, the predicted depth maps are sparse. Inferring depth information from a single image (monocular depth estimation) is an ill-posed problem. With the rapid development of deep neural networks, monocular depth estimation based on deep learning has been widely studied recently and achieved promising performance in accuracy. Meanwhile, dense depth maps are estimated from single images by deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner. In order to improve the accuracy of depth estimation, different kinds of network frameworks, loss functions and training strategies are proposed subsequently. Therefore, we survey the current monocular depth estimation methods based on deep learning in this review. Initially, we conclude several widely used datasets and evaluation indicators in deep learning-based depth estimation. Furthermore, we review some representative existing methods according to different training manners: supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Finally, we discuss the challenges and provide some ideas for future researches in monocular depth estimation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures | None |

Results of human detection and tracking from two cameras are integrated to obtain the 3D information. OpenPose is used for human detection. In the case of a general processing a stereo camera, a range image of the entire scene is acquired as precisely as possible, and then the range image is processed. However, there are problems such as incorrect matching and computational cost for the calibration process. A new stereo vision framework is proposed to cope with the problems. The effectiveness of the proposed framework and the method is verified through target-tracking experiments.</p></details> | 4 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[FP-Stereo: Hardware-Efficient Stereo Vision for Embedded Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03250v4)** | 2020-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate depth estimation, or stereo matching, is essential in embedded stereo vision systems, requiring substantial design effort to achieve an appropriate balance among accuracy, speed and hardware cost. To reduce the design effort and achieve the right balance, we propose FP-Stereo for building high-performance stereo matching pipelines on FPGAs automatically. FP-Stereo consists of an open-source hardware-efficient library, allowing designers to obtain the desired implementation instantly. Diverse methods are supported in our library for each stage of the stereo matching pipeline and a series of techniques are developed to exploit the parallelism and reduce the resource overhead. To improve the usability, FP-Stereo can generate synthesizable C code of the FPGA accelerator with our optimized HLS templates automatically. To guide users for the right design choice meeting specific application requirements, detailed comparisons are performed on various configurations of our library to investigate the accuracy/speed/cost trade-off. Experimental results also show that FP-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art FPGA design from all aspects, including 6.08% lower error, 2x faster speed, 30% less resource usage and 40% less energy consumption. Compared to GPU designs, FP-Stereo achieves the same accuracy at a competitive speed while consuming much less energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL), 2020</p></details> | None |
| **[Bi3D: Stereo Depth Estimation via Binary Classifications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07274v2)** | 2020-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo-based depth estimation is a cornerstone of computer vision, with state-of-the-art methods delivering accurate results in real time. For several applications such as autonomous navigation, however, it may be useful to trade accuracy for lower latency. We present Bi3D, a method that estimates depth via a series of binary classifications. Rather than testing if objects are at a particular depth $D$, as existing stereo methods do, it classifies them as being closer or farther than $D$. This property offers a powerful mechanism to balance accuracy and latency. Given a strict time budget, Bi3D can detect objects closer than a given distance in as little as a few milliseconds, or estimate depth with arbitrarily coarse quantization, with complexity linear with the number of quantization levels. Bi3D can also use the allotted quantization levels to get continuous depth, but in a specific depth range. For standard stereo (i.e., continuous depth on the whole range), our method is close to or on par with state-of-the-art, finely tuned stereo methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR 2020</p></details> | None |
| **[Stereo Vision Based Single-Shot 6D Object Pose Estimation for Bin-Picking by a Robot Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13759v1)** | 2020-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a fast and accurate method of 6D object pose estimation for bin-picking of mechanical parts by a robot manipulator. We extend the single-shot approach to stereo vision by application of attention architecture. Our convolutional neural network model regresses to object locations and rotations from either a left image or a right image without depth information. Then, a stereo feature matching module, designated as Stereo Grid Attention, generates stereo grid matching maps. The important point of our method is only to calculate disparity of the objects found by the attention from stereo images, instead of calculating a point cloud over the entire image. The disparity value is then used to calculate the depth to the objects by the principle of triangulation. Our method also achieves a rapid processing speed of pose estimation by the single-shot architecture and it is possible to process a 1024 x 1024 pixels image in 75 milliseconds on the Jetson AGX Xavier implemented with half-float model. Weakly textured mechanical parts are used to exemplify the method. First, we create original synthetic datasets for training and evaluating of the proposed model. This dataset is created by capturing and rendering numerous 3D models of several types of mechanical parts in virtual space. Finally, we use a robotic manipulator with an electromagnetic gripper to pick up the mechanical parts in a cluttered state to verify the validity of our method in an actual scene. When a raw stereo image is used by the proposed method from our stereo camera to detect black steel screws, stainless screws, and DC motor parts, i.e., cases, rotor cores and commutator caps, the bin-picking tasks are successful with 76.3%, 64.0%, 50.5%, 89.1% and 64.2% probability, respectively.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Stereo Vision for Unmanned Aerial VehicleDetection, Tracking, and Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04183v1)** | 2020-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An innovative method of detecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is presented. The goal of this study is to develop a robust setup for an autonomous multi-rotor hunter UAV, capable of visually detecting and tracking the intruder UAVs for real-time motion planning. The system consists of two parts: object detection using a stereo camera to generate 3D point cloud data and video tracking applying a Kalman filter for UAV motion modeling. After detection, the hunter can aim and shoot a tethered net at the intruder to neutralize it. The computer vision, motion tracking, and planning algorithms can be implemented on a portable computer installed on the hunter UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted as a Late-Breaking result at the IFAC World Congress 2020</p></details> | None |
| **[Preintegrated Velocity Bias Estimation to Overcome Contact Nonlinearities in Legged Robot Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09875v2)** | 2020-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel factor graph formulation to estimate the pose and velocity of a quadruped robot on slippery and deformable terrain. The factor graph introduces a preintegrated velocity factor that incorporates velocity inputs from leg odometry and also estimates related biases. From our experimentation we have seen that it is difficult to model uncertainties at the contact point such as slip or deforming terrain, as well as leg flexibility. To accommodate for these effects and to minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state vector with a bias term for this preintegrated velocity factor. The bias term can be accurately estimated thanks to the tight fusion of the preintegrated velocity factor with stereo vision and IMU factors, without which it would be unobservable. The system has been validated on several scenarios that involve dynamic motions of the ANYmal robot on loose rocks, slopes and muddy ground. We demonstrate a 26% improvement of relative pose error compared to our previous work and 52% compared to a state-of-the-art proprioceptive state estimator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2020.

| **[Active stereo vision three-dimensional reconstruction by RGB dot pattern projection and ray intersection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13322v2)** | 2020-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active stereo vision is important in reconstructing objects without obvious textures. However, it is still very challenging to extract and match the projected patterns from two camera views automatically and robustly. In this paper, we propose a new pattern extraction method and a new stereo vision matching method based on our novel structured light pattern. Instead of using the widely used 2D disparity to calculate the depths of the objects, we use the ray intersection to compute the 3D shapes directly. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach could reconstruct the 3D shape of the object significantly more robustly than state of the art methods that include the widely used disparity based active stereo vision method, the time of flight method and the structured light method. In addition, experimental results also showed that the proposed approach could reconstruct the 3D motions of the dynamic shapes robustly.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art methods utilize learning-based algorithms, where the amount and quality of training samples heavily influence results. Existing stereo image datasets are limited either in size or subject variety. Hence, algorithms trained on such datasets do not generalize well to scenarios encountered in mobile photography. We present Holopix50k, a novel in-the-wild stereo image dataset, comprising 49,368 image pairs contributed by users of the Holopix mobile social platform. In this work, we describe our data collection process and statistically compare our dataset to other popular stereo datasets. We experimentally show that using our dataset significantly improves results for tasks such as stereo super-resolution and self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our dataset to motivate novel works and use cases.
