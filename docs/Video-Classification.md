| **[Deep Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment: Proxy Features from Carotid Sonography as Predictors of Arterial Damage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06680v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, hypertension is utilized as an indicator of individual vascular damage. This damage can be identified through machine learning techniques, providing an early risk marker for potential major cardiovascular events and offering valuable insights into the overall arterial condition of individual patients. To this end, the VideoMAE deep learning model, originally developed for video classification, was adapted by finetuning for application in the domain of ultrasound imaging. The model was trained and tested using a dataset comprising over 31,000 carotid sonography videos sourced from the Gutenberg Health Study (15,010 participants), one of the largest prospective population health studies. This adaptation facilitates the classification of individuals as hypertensive or non-hypertensive (75.7% validation accuracy), functioning as a proxy for detecting visual arterial damage. We demonstrate that our machine learning model effectively captures visual features that provide valuable insights into an individual's overall cardiovascular health.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REEF: Relevance-Aware and Efficient LLM Adapter for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05491v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating vision models into large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in creating vision-language foundation models, especially for video understanding. Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%. The code will be available soon on GitHub.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPRW'25 | None |
| **[AdaCM$^2$: On Understanding Extremely Long-Term Video with Adaptive Cross-Modality Memory Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12593v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Highlight | None |
| **[TenAd: A Tensor-based Low-rank Black Box Adversarial Attack for Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01228v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in black-box settings where model details are unknown. Existing adversarial attack methods(even those works with key frames) often treat video data as simple vectors, ignoring their inherent multi-dimensional structure, and require a large number of queries, making them inefficient and detectable. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TenAd}, a novel tensor-based low-rank adversarial attack that leverages the multi-dimensional properties of video data by representing videos as fourth-order tensors. By exploiting low-rank attack, our method significantly reduces the search space and the number of queries needed to generate adversarial examples in black-box settings. Experimental results on standard video classification datasets demonstrate that \textbf{TenAd} effectively generates imperceptible adversarial perturbations while achieving higher attack success rates and query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach outperforms existing black-box adversarial attacks in terms of success rate, query efficiency, and perturbation imperceptibility, highlighting the potential of tensor-based methods for adversarial attacks on video models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transfer-learning for video classification: Video Swin Transformer on multiple domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09969v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computer vision community has seen a shift from convolutional-based to pure transformer architectures for both image and video tasks. Training a transformer from zero for these tasks usually requires a lot of data and computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch. We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly actions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Unbiasing through Textual Descriptions: Mitigating Representation Bias in Video Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18637v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new "Unbiased through Textual Description (UTD)" video benchmark based on unbiased subsets of existing video classification and retrieval datasets to enable a more robust assessment of video understanding capabilities. Namely, we tackle the problem that current video benchmarks may suffer from different representation biases, e.g., object bias or single-frame bias, where mere recognition of objects or utilization of only a single frame is sufficient for correct prediction. We leverage VLMs and LLMs to analyze and debias benchmarks from such representation biases. Specifically, we generate frame-wise textual descriptions of videos, filter them for specific information (e.g. only objects) and leverage them to examine representation biases across three dimensions: 1) concept bias - determining if a specific concept (e.g., objects) alone suffice for prediction; 2) temporal bias - assessing if temporal information contributes to prediction; and 3) common sense vs. dataset bias - evaluating whether zero-shot reasoning or dataset correlations contribute to prediction. We conduct a systematic analysis of 12 popular video classification and retrieval datasets and create new object-debiased test splits for these datasets. Moreover, we benchmark 30 state-of-the-art video models on original and debiased splits and analyze biases in the models. To facilitate the future development of more robust video understanding benchmarks and models, we release: "UTD-descriptions", a dataset with our rich structured descriptions for each dataset, and "UTD-splits", a dataset of object-debiased test splits.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at CVPR 2025, project webpage https://utd-project.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatiotemporal Learning with Context-aware Video Tubelets for Ultrasound Video Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17475v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided pathology detection algorithms for video-based imaging modalities must accurately interpret complex spatiotemporal information by integrating findings across multiple frames. Current state-of-the-art methods operate by classifying on video sub-volumes (tubelets), but they often lose global spatial context by focusing only on local regions within detection ROIs. Here we propose a lightweight framework for tubelet-based object detection and video classification that preserves both global spatial context and fine spatiotemporal features. To address the loss of global context, we embed tubelet location, size, and confidence as inputs to the classifier. Additionally, we use ROI-aligned feature maps from a pre-trained detection model, leveraging learned feature representations to increase the receptive field and reduce computational complexity. Our method is efficient, with the spatiotemporal tubelet classifier comprising only 0.4M parameters. We apply our approach to detect and classify lung consolidation and pleural effusion in ultrasound videos. Five-fold cross-validation on 14,804 videos from 828 patients shows our method outperforms previous tubelet-based approaches and is suited for real-time workflows.</p></details> | ISBI Oral 2025 | None |
| **[Ultrasound Image-to-Video Synthesis via Latent Dynamic Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14966v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound video classification enables automated diagnosis and has emerged as an important research area. However, publicly available ultrasound video datasets remain scarce, hindering progress in developing effective video classification models. We propose addressing this shortage by synthesizing plausible ultrasound videos from readily available, abundant ultrasound images. To this end, we introduce a latent dynamic diffusion model (LDDM) to efficiently translate static images to dynamic sequences with realistic video characteristics. We demonstrate strong quantitative results and visually appealing synthesized videos on the BUSV benchmark. Notably, training video classification models on combinations of real and LDDM-synthesized videos substantially improves performance over using real data alone, indicating our method successfully emulates dynamics critical for discrimination. Our image-to-video approach provides an effective data augmentation solution to advance ultrasound video analysis.

| **[Domain Generalization for Improved Human Activity Recognition in Office Space Videos Using Adaptive Pre-processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12678v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic video activity recognition is crucial across numerous domains like surveillance, healthcare, and robotics. However, recognizing human activities from video data becomes challenging when training and test data stem from diverse domains. Domain generalization, adapting to unforeseen domains, is thus essential. This paper focuses on office activity recognition amidst environmental variability. We propose three pre-processing techniques applicable to any video encoder, enhancing robustness against environmental variations. Our study showcases the efficacy of MViT, a leading state-of-the-art video classification model, and other video encoders combined with our techniques, outperforming state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. Our approach significantly boosts accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score on unseen domains, emphasizing its adaptability in real-world scenarios with diverse video data sources. This method lays a foundation for more reliable video activity recognition systems across heterogeneous data domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accurate and Efficient Two-Stage Gun Detection in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06317v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in videos plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as public safety and anomaly detection. Existing methods have explored different techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for object detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects, e.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying appearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for classification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection scenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing efficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing models capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To address these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper. First, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification and object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis shows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we propose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an image-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the detection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model to locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified as ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements and enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques. We also discuss challenges and future research directions in gun detection tasks in computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Inference-Scale Complexity in ANN-SNN Conversion for High-Performance and Low-Power Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03368v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and low power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction.

| **[Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20279v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a research area focusing on using optimisation techniques to design machine learning (ML) algorithms, alleviating the need for a human to perform manual algorithm design. Real-time AutoML enables the design process to happen while the ML algorithm is being applied to a task. Real-time AutoML is an emerging research area, as such existing real-time AutoML techniques need improvement with respect to the quality of designs and time taken to create designs. To address these issues, this study proposes an Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR) approach. Meta-learning gathers information about the optimisation process undertaken by the ML algorithm in the form of meta-features. Meta-features are used in conjunction with a meta-learner to optimise the optimisation process. The OnMAR approach uses a meta-learner to predict the accuracy of an ML design. If the accuracy predicted by the meta-learner is sufficient, the design is used, and if the predicted accuracy is low, an optimisation technique creates a new design. A genetic algorithm (GA) is the optimisation technique used as part of the OnMAR approach. Different meta-learners (k-nearest neighbours, random forest and XGBoost) are tested. The OnMAR approach is model-agnostic (i.e. not specific to a single real-time AutoML application) and therefore evaluated on three different real-time AutoML applications, namely: composing an image clustering algorithm, configuring the hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network, and configuring a video classification pipeline. The OnMAR approach is effective, matching or outperforming existing real-time AutoML approaches, with the added benefit of a faster runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First page is a graphical abstract, this is a journal article submission</p></details> | None |
| **[Variable-frame CNNLSTM for Breast Nodule Classification using Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11481v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intersection of medical imaging and artificial intelligence has become an important research direction in intelligent medical treatment, particularly in the analysis of medical images using deep learning for clinical diagnosis. Despite the advances, existing keyframe classification methods lack extraction of time series features, while ultrasonic video classification based on three-dimensional convolution requires uniform frame numbers across patients, resulting in poor feature extraction efficiency and model classification performance. This study proposes a novel video classification method based on CNN and LSTM, introducing NLP's long and short sentence processing scheme into video classification for the first time. The method reduces CNN-extracted image features to 1x512 dimension, followed by sorting and compressing feature vectors for LSTM training. Specifically, feature vectors are sorted by patient video frame numbers and populated with padding value 0 to form variable batches, with invalid padding values compressed before LSTM training to conserve computing resources. Experimental results demonstrate that our variable-frame CNNLSTM method outperforms other approaches across all metrics, showing improvements of 3-6% in F1 score and 1.5% in specificity compared to keyframe methods. The variable-frame CNNLSTM also achieves better accuracy and precision than equal-frame CNNLSTM. These findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in classifying variable-frame ultrasound videos and suggest potential applications in other medical imaging modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

We contribute a novel approach to improving GPT's performance through prompt optimization and policy refinement, demonstrating that simplifying complex policies significantly reduces false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods. These experiments, conducted on real industry problems, show that thoughtful prompt design can substantially enhance GPT's performance without additional finetuning, offering an effective and scalable solution for improving video classification systems across various domains in industry.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gramian Multimodal Representation Learning and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11959v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification. The project page, the code, and the pretrained models are available at https://ispamm.github.io/GRAM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ispamm.github.io/GRAM) |
| **[TEST-V: TEst-time Support-set Tuning for Zero-shot Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00426v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, adapting Vision Language Models (VLMs) to zero-shot visual classification by tuning class embedding with a few prompts (Test-time Prompt Tuning, TPT) or replacing class names with generated visual samples (support-set) has shown promising results. However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BRIDLE: Generalized Self-supervised Learning with Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02118v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has been a powerful approach for learning meaningful representations from unlabeled data across various domains, reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets. Inspired by BERT's success in capturing deep bidirectional contexts in natural language processing, similar frameworks have been adapted to other modalities such as audio, with models like BEATs extending the bidirectional training paradigm to audio signals using vector quantization (VQ). However, these frameworks face challenges, notably their dependence on a single codebook for quantization, which may not capture the complex, multifaceted nature of signals. In addition, inefficiencies in codebook utilization lead to underutilized code vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce BRIDLE (Bidirectional Residual Quantization Interleaved Discrete Learning Encoder), a self-supervised encoder pretraining framework that incorporates residual quantization (RQ) into the bidirectional training process, and is generalized for pretraining with audio, image, and video. Using multiple hierarchical codebooks, RQ enables fine-grained discretization in the latent space, enhancing representation quality. BRIDLE involves an interleaved training procedure between the encoder and tokenizer. We evaluate BRIDLE on audio understanding tasks using classification benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate competitive performance on image classification and video classification tasks, showing consistent improvements over traditional VQ methods in downstream performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While most traditional explainability methods are designed for image models, our IBA framework addresses the need for explainability in temporal models used for video analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply VIBA to video deepfake detection, testing it on two architectures: the Xception model for spatial features and a VGG11-based model for capturing motion dynamics through optical flow. Using a custom dataset that reflects recent deepfake generation techniques, we adapt IBA to create relevance and optical flow maps, visually highlighting manipulated regions and motion inconsistencies. Our results show that VIBA generates temporally and spatially consistent explanations, which align closely with human annotations, thus providing interpretability for video classification and particularly for deepfake detection.</p></details> |  | None |

In large documents, there are ample amounts of words that exhibit different viewpoints. Deep learning (DL) models comprise of complex neural network architectures that have the ability to learn diverse features of the data to classify various sentiments. Besides audio, image and video classification; DL algorithms are now extensively used in text-based classification problems. To explore the powerful DL techniques for Urdu SA, we have applied five different DL architectures namely, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT). In this paper, we have proposed a DL hybrid model that integrates BiLSTM with Single Layer Multi Filter Convolutional Neural Network (BiLSTM-SLMFCNN). The proposed and baseline techniques are applied on Urdu Customer Support data set and IMDB Urdu movie review data set by using pretrained Urdu word embeddings that are suitable for (SA) at the document level. Results of these techniques are evaluated and our proposed model outperforms all other DL techniques for Urdu SA. BiLSTM-SLMFCNN outperformed the baseline DL models and achieved 83{\%}, 79{\%}, 83{\%} and 94{\%} accuracy on small, medium and large sized IMDB Urdu movie review data set and Urdu Customer Support data set respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12524v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2025</p></details> | None |

This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However, the development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3) Rich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions and classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This classification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse, aiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators and present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental results including advanced video classification models as baselines. With the GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models. Datasets and code are available at https://genvidbench.github.io.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[When language and vision meet road safety: leveraging multimodal large language models for video-based traffic accident analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10604v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of traffic videos functioning on a 24/7/365 time scale has the great potential of increasing the spatio-temporal coverage of traffic accidents, which will help improve traffic safety. However, analyzing footage from hundreds, if not thousands, of traffic cameras in a 24/7/365 working protocol remains an extremely challenging task, as current vision-based approaches primarily focus on extracting raw information, such as vehicle trajectories or individual object detection, but require laborious post-processing to derive actionable insights. We propose SeeUnsafe, a new framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents to transform video-based traffic accident analysis from a traditional extraction-then-explanation workflow to a more interactive, conversational approach. This shift significantly enhances processing throughput by automating complex tasks like video classification and visual grounding, while improving adaptability by enabling seamless adjustments to diverse traffic scenarios and user-defined queries. Our framework employs a severity-based aggregation strategy to handle videos of various lengths and a novel multimodal prompt to generate structured responses for review and evaluation and enable fine-grained visual grounding. We introduce IMS (Information Matching Score), a new MLLM-based metric for aligning structured responses with ground truth. We conduct extensive experiments on the Toyota Woven Traffic Safety dataset, demonstrating that SeeUnsafe effectively performs accident-aware video classification and visual grounding by leveraging off-the-shelf MLLMs. Source code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe) |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot & Explainable Video Description by Reasoning over Graphs of Events in Space and Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08460v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current era of Machine Learning, Transformers have become the de facto approach across a variety of domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Transformer-based solutions are the backbone of current state-of-the-art methods for language generation, image and video classification, segmentation, action and object recognition, among many others. Interestingly enough, while these state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results in their respective domains, the problem of understanding the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a common ground between vision and language based on events in space and time in an explainable and programmatic way, to connect learning-based vision and language state of the art models and provide a solution to the long standing problem of describing videos in natural language. We validate that our algorithmic approach is able to generate coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from a variety of datasets, using both standard metrics (e.g. Bleu, ROUGE) and the modern LLM-as-a-Jury approach.</p></details> |  | None |

We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate.

We propose a novel approach towards echocardiographic viewpoint classification. We show that treating viewpoint classification as video classification rather than image classification yields advantage. We propose a CNN-GRU architecture with a novel temporal feature weaving method, which leverages both spatial and temporal information to yield a 4.33\% increase in accuracy over baseline image classification while using only four consecutive frames. The proposed approach incurs minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we publish the Neonatal Echocardiogram Dataset (NED), a professionally-annotated dataset providing sixteen viewpoints and associated echocardipgraphy videos to encourage future work and development in this field.

Inspired by transfer learning techniques in NLP, adapters and prefix tuning, this paper presents a new model-agnostic plugin architecture for cross-learning, called CM3T, that adapts transformer-based models to new or missing information. We introduce two adapter blocks: multi-head vision adapters for transfer learning and cross-attention adapters for multimodal learning. Training becomes substantially efficient as the backbone and other plugins do not need to be finetuned along with these additions. Comparative and ablation studies on three datasets Epic-Kitchens-100, MPIIGroupInteraction and UDIVA v0.5 show efficacy of this framework on different recording settings and tasks. With only 12.8% trainable parameters compared to the backbone to process video input and only 22.3% trainable parameters for two additional modalities, we achieve comparable and even better results than the state-of-the-art. CM3T has no specific requirements for training or pretraining and is a step towards bridging the gap between a general model and specific practical applications of video classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Popularity is measured by four key engagement metrics: view count, like count, comment count, and share count. This study employs video classification models with different architectures and training methods as backbone networks to extract video modality features. Meanwhile, the cleaned video captions are incorporated into a carefully designed prompt framework, along with the video, as input for video-to-text generation models, which generate detailed text-based video content understanding. These texts are then encoded into vectors using a pre-trained BERT model. Based on the six sets of vectors mentioned above, a neural network is trained for each of the four prediction metrics. Moreover, the study conducts data mining and feature engineering based on the video and tabular data, constructing practical features such as the total frequency of hashtag appearances, the total frequency of mention appearances, video duration, frame count, frame rate, and total time online. Multiple machine learning models are trained, and the most stable model, XGBoost, is selected. Finally, the predictions from the neural network and XGBoost models are averaged to obtain the final result.</p></details> | <details><summary>INFOR...</summary><p>INFORMS 2024 Data Challenge Competition</p></details> | None |

Despite these advancements, evaluation of MU methods have been inconsistent, employing different trained models and architectures, and sample removal strategies, which hampers accurate comparison. In addition, prior MU approaches have mainly focused on singular tasks or modalities, which is not comprehensive. To address these limitations, we develop MU-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for MU that (i) unifies the sets of deleted samples and trained models, and (ii) provides broad coverage of tasks and data modalities, including previously unexplored domains such as speech and video classification. Our evaluation show that RandLabel and SalUn are the most effective general MU approaches on MU-Bench, and BadT and SCRUB are capable of achieving random performance on the deletion set. We analyze several under-investigated aspects of unlearning, including scalability, the impacts of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and curriculum learning, and susceptibility to dataset biases. MU-Bench provides an easy-to-use package that includes dataset splits, models, and implementations, together with a leader board to enable unified and scalable MU research.</p></details> | <details><summary>SafeG...</summary><p>SafeGenAI @ NeurIPS 2024.

Frameworks have been developed for each sub-field; however, building a common system or framework that combines both is something that has not been explored. As part of our research, we present the first unified framework that combines domain adaptation for the few-shot learning setting across 3 different tasks - image classification, object detection and video classification. Our framework is highly modular with the capability to support few-shot learning with/without the inclusion of domain adaptation depending on the algorithm. Furthermore, the most important configurable feature of our framework is the on-the-fly setup for incremental $n$-shot tasks with the optional capability to configure the system to scale to a traditional many-shot task. With more focus on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for current few-shot learning approaches, our system also supports multiple SSL pre-training configurations. To test our framework's capabilities, we provide benchmarks on a wide range of algorithms and datasets across different task and problem settings.

| **[Discrepancy-Aware Attention Network for Enhanced Audio-Visual Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11715v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has attracted significant attention for its ability to identify unseen classes and perform well in video classification tasks. However, modal imbalance in (G)ZSL leads to over-reliance on the optimal modality, reducing discriminative capabilities for unseen classes. Some studies have attempted to address this issue by modifying parameter gradients, but two challenges still remain: (a) Quality discrepancies, where modalities offer differing quantities and qualities of information for the same concept. (b) Content discrepancies, where sample contributions within a modality vary significantly. To address these challenges, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Attention Network (DAAN) for Enhanced Audio-Visual ZSL. Our approach introduces a Quality-Discrepancy Mitigation Attention (QDMA) unit to minimize redundant information in the high-quality modality and a Contrastive Sample-level Gradient Modulation (CSGM) block to adjust gradient magnitudes and balance content discrepancies. We quantify modality contributions by integrating optimization and convergence rate for more precise gradient modulation in CSGM. Experiments demonstrates DAAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of individual modules.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Optimizing Violence Detection in Video Classification Accuracy through 3D Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01348v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As violent crimes continue to happen, it becomes necessary to have security cameras that can rapidly identify moments of violence with excellent accuracy. The purpose of this study is to identify how many frames should be analyzed at a time in order to optimize a violence detection model's accuracy as a parameter of the depth of a 3D convolutional network. Previous violence classification models have been created, but their application to live footage may be flawed. In this project, a convolutional neural network was created to analyze optical flow frames of each video. The number of frames analyzed at a time would vary with one, two, three, ten, and twenty frames, and each model would be trained for 20 epochs. The greatest validation accuracy was 94.87% and occurred with the model that analyzed three frames at a time. This means that machine learning models to detect violence may function better when analyzing three frames at a time for this dataset. The methodology used to identify the optimal number of frames to analyze at a time could be used in other applications of video classification, especially those of complex or abstract actions, such as violence.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Video Token Merging for Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23782v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the scale of data and models for video understanding rapidly expand, handling long-form video input in transformer-based models presents a practical challenge. Rather than resorting to input sampling or token dropping, which may result in information loss, token merging shows promising results when used in collaboration with transformers. However, the application of token merging for long-form video processing is not trivial. We begin with the premise that token merging should not rely solely on the similarity of video tokens; the saliency of tokens should also be considered. To address this, we explore various video token merging strategies for long-form video classification, starting with a simple extension of image token merging, moving to region-concentrated merging, and finally proposing a learnable video token merging (VTM) algorithm that dynamically merges tokens based on their saliency. Extensive experimental results show that we achieve better or comparable performances on the LVU, COIN, and Breakfast datasets. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces memory costs by 84% and boosts throughput by approximately 6.89 times compared to baseline algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Few-Shot Classification of Interactive Activities of Daily Living (InteractADL)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01662v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a crucial step for different applications including assistive robots, smart homes, and healthcare. However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions in home environments. In this paper, we propose a new dataset and benchmark, InteractADL, for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Furthermore, complex ADLs occurring in home environments comprise a challenging long-tailed distribution due to the rarity of multi-person interactions, and pose fine-grained visual recognition tasks due to the presence of semantically and visually similar classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for fine-grained few-shot video classification called Name Tuning that enables greater semantic separability by learning optimal class name vectors. We show that Name Tuning can be combined with existing prompt tuning strategies to learn the entire input text (rather than only learning the prompt or class names) and demonstrate improved performance for few-shot classification on InteractADL and 4 other fine-grained visual classification benchmarks. For transparency and reproducibility, we release our code at https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark) |
| **[Short-Form Videos and Mental Health: A Knowledge-Guided Neural Topic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10045v4)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with the rise of short-form videos, their mental impacts on viewers have led to widespread consequences, prompting platforms to predict videos' impact on viewers' mental health. Subsequently, they can take intervention measures according to their community guidelines. Nevertheless, applicable predictive methods lack relevance to well-established medical knowledge, which outlines clinically proven external and environmental factors of mental disorders. To account for such medical knowledge, we resort to an emergent methodological discipline, seeded Neural Topic Models (NTMs). However, existing seeded NTMs suffer from the limitations of single-origin topics, unknown topic sources, unclear seed supervision, and suboptimal convergence. To address those challenges, we develop a novel Knowledge-Guided NTM to predict a short-form video's suicidal thought impact on viewers. Extensive empirical analyses using TikTok and Douyin datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our method also discovers medically relevant topics from videos that are linked to suicidal thought impact. We contribute to IS with a novel video analytics method that is generalizable to other video classification problems. Practically, our method can help platforms understand videos' suicidal thought impacts, thus moderating videos that violate their community guidelines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CPFD: Confidence-aware Privileged Feature Distillation for Short Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03038v2)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense features, customized for different business scenarios, are essential in short video classification. However, their complexity, specific adaptation requirements, and high computational costs make them resource-intensive and less accessible during online inference. Consequently, these dense features are categorized as `Privileged Dense Features'.Meanwhile, end-to-end multi-modal models have shown promising results in numerous computer vision tasks. In industrial applications, prioritizing end-to-end multi-modal features, can enhance efficiency but often leads to the loss of valuable information from historical privileged dense features. To integrate both features while maintaining efficiency and manageable resource costs, we present Confidence-aware Privileged Feature Distillation (CPFD), which empowers features of an end-to-end multi-modal model by adaptively distilling privileged features during training. Unlike existing privileged feature distillation (PFD) methods, which apply uniform weights to all instances during distillation, potentially causing unstable performance across different business scenarios and a notable performance gap between teacher model (Dense Feature enhanced multimodal-model DF-X-VLM) and student model (multimodal-model only X-VLM), our CPFD leverages confidence scores derived from the teacher model to adaptively mitigate the performance variance with the student model. We conducted extensive offline experiments on five diverse tasks demonstrating that CPFD improves the video classification F1 score by 6.76% compared with end-to-end multimodal-model (X-VLM) and by 2.31% with vanilla PFD on-average. And it reduces the performance gap by 84.6% and achieves results comparable to teacher model DF-X-VLM. The effectiveness of CPFD is further substantiated by online experiments, and our framework has been deployed in production systems for over a dozen models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready for CIKM 2024</p></details> | None |

Traditional moderation methods often fall short in handling the vast and rapidly changing landscape of user-generated videos, increasing the risk of children encountering harmful material. This paper introduces TikGuard, a transformer-based deep learning approach aimed at detecting and flagging content unsuitable for children on TikTok. By using a specially curated dataset, TikHarm, and leveraging advanced video classification techniques, TikGuard achieves an accuracy of 86.7%, showing a notable improvement over existing methods in similar contexts. While direct comparisons are limited by the uniqueness of the TikHarm dataset, TikGuard's performance highlights its potential in enhancing content moderation, contributing to a safer online experience for minors.

While current approaches often involve scaling down modern hardware, the performance characteristics of neural network workloads on these platforms can vary significantly, especially when it comes to parallel processing, which is a critical consideration for edge deployments. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study comparing the latency and throughput of various linear algebra and neural network inference tasks across CPU-only, CPU/GPU, and CPU/NPU integrated solutions. {We find that the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) excels in matrix-vector multiplication (58.6% faster) and some neural network tasks (3.2$\times$ faster for video classification and large language models). GPU outperforms in matrix multiplication (22.6% faster) and LSTM networks (2.7$\times$ faster) while CPU excels at less parallel operations like dot product. NPU-based inference offers a balance of latency and throughput at lower power consumption. GPU-based inference, though more energy-intensive, performs best with large dimensions and batch sizes. We highlight the potential of heterogeneous computing solutions for edge AI, where diverse compute units can be strategically leveraged to boost accurate and real-time inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pushing the boundaries of event subsampling in event-based video classification using CNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08953v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer low-power visual sensing capabilities ideal for edge-device applications. However, their high event rate, driven by high temporal details, can be restrictive in terms of bandwidth and computational resources. In edge AI applications, determining the minimum amount of events for specific tasks can allow reducing the event rate to improve bandwidth, memory, and processing efficiency. In this paper, we study the effect of event subsampling on the accuracy of event data classification using convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Surprisingly, across various datasets, the number of events per video can be reduced by an order of magnitude with little drop in accuracy, revealing the extent to which we can push the boundaries in accuracy vs. event rate trade-off. Additionally, we also find that lower classification accuracy in high subsampling rates is not solely attributable to information loss due to the subsampling of the events, but that the training of CNNs can be challenging in highly subsampled scenarios, where the sensitivity to hyperparameters increases. We quantify training instability across multiple event-based classification datasets using a novel metric for evaluating the hyperparameter sensitivity of CNNs in different subsampling settings. Finally, we analyze the weight gradients of the network to gain insight into this instability.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce MovieSeq, a multimodal language model developed to address the wide range of challenges in understanding video contexts. Our core idea is to represent videos as interleaved multimodal sequences (including images, plots, videos, and subtitles), either by linking external knowledge databases or using offline models (such as whisper for subtitles). Through instruction-tuning, this approach empowers the language model to interact with videos using interleaved multimodal instructions. For example, instead of solely relying on video as input, we jointly provide character photos alongside their names and dialogues, allowing the model to associate these elements and generate more comprehensive responses. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we validate MovieSeq's performance on six datasets (LVU, MAD, Movienet, CMD, TVC, MovieQA) across five settings (video classification, audio description, video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video question-answering).

Not just brute-force search, but most existing methods suffer from its vast search space of $\binom{T}{N}$, especially when $N$ gets large. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective of reducing the search space from $O(T^N)$ to $O(T)$. Instead of exploring the entire $O(T^N)$ space, our proposed semi-optimal policy selects the top $N$ frames based on the independently estimated value of each frame using per-frame confidence, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We verify that our semi-optimal policy can efficiently approximate the optimal policy, particularly under practical settings. Additionally, through extensive experiments on various datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that learning our semi-optimal policy ensures stable and high performance regardless of the size of $N$ and $T$.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in the more complex video classification domain, SNN-based methods fall considerably short of ANN-based benchmarks due to the challenges in processing dense frame sequences. To bridge this gap, we propose ReSpike, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of ANNs and SNNs to tackle action recognition tasks with high accuracy and low energy cost. By decomposing film clips into spatial and temporal components, i.e., RGB image Key Frames and event-like Residual Frames, ReSpike leverages ANN for learning spatial information and SNN for learning temporal information. In addition, we propose a multi-scale cross-attention mechanism for effective feature fusion. Compared to state-of-the-art SNN baselines, our ReSpike hybrid architecture demonstrates significant performance improvements (e.g., >30% absolute accuracy improvement on HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400). Furthermore, ReSpike achieves comparable performance with prior ANN approaches while bringing better accuracy-energy tradeoff.</p></details> |  | None |

Smaller architectures, on the other hand, struggle to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Attend-Fusion, an audio-visual (AV) fusion approach that introduces a compact model architecture specifically designed to capture intricate audio-visual relationships in video data. Through extensive experiments on the challenging YouTube-8M dataset, we demonstrate that Attend-Fusion achieves an F1 score of 75.64\% with only 72M parameters, which is comparable to the performance of larger baseline models such as Fully-Connected Late Fusion (75.96\% F1 score, 341M parameters). Attend-Fusion achieves similar performance to the larger baseline model while reducing the model size by nearly 80\%, highlighting its efficiency in terms of model complexity. Our work demonstrates that the Attend-Fusion model effectively combines audio and visual information for video classification, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced model size. This approach opens new possibilities for deploying high-performance video understanding systems in resource-constrained environments across various applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the popularity of video content on social media platforms, these models intensify concerns about the spread of fake information. Therefore, there is a growing demand for detectors capable of distinguishing between fake AI-generated videos and mitigating the potential harm caused by fake information. However, the lack of large-scale datasets from the most advanced video generators poses a barrier to the development of such detectors. To address this gap, we introduce the first AI-generated video detection dataset, GenVideo. It features the following characteristics: (1) a large volume of videos, including over one million AI-generated and real videos collected; (2) a rich diversity of generated content and methodologies, covering a broad spectrum of video categories and generation techniques. We conducted extensive studies of the dataset and proposed two evaluation methods tailored for real-world-like scenarios to assess the detectors' performance: the cross-generator video classification task assesses the generalizability of trained detectors on generators; the degraded video classification task evaluates the robustness of detectors to handle videos that have degraded in quality during dissemination. Moreover, we introduced a plug-and-play module, named Detail Mamba (DeMamba), designed to enhance the detectors by identifying AI-generated videos through the analysis of inconsistencies in temporal and spatial dimensions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate DeMamba's superior generalizability and robustness on GenVideo compared to existing detectors. We believe that the GenVideo dataset and the DeMamba module will significantly advance the field of AI-generated video detection.

However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Therefore, a deep understanding of adversarial attacks can better respond to emergency situations. In order to improve attack performance, many style-transfer-based attacks and patch-based attacks have been proposed. However, the global perturbation of the former will bring unnatural global color, while the latter is difficult to achieve success in targeted attacks due to the limited perturbation space. Moreover, compared to a plethora of methods targeting image classifiers, video adversarial attacks are still not that popular. Therefore, to generate adversarial examples with a low budget and to provide them with a higher verisimilitude, we propose a novel black-box video attack framework, called Stylized Logo Attack (SLA). SLA is conducted through three steps. The first step involves building a style references set for logos, which can not only make the generated examples more natural, but also carry more target class features in the targeted attacks. Then, reinforcement learning (RL) is employed to determine the style reference and position parameters of the logo within the video, which ensures that the stylized logo is placed in the video with optimal attributes. Finally, perturbation optimization is designed to optimize perturbations to improve the fooling rate in a step-by-step manner. Sufficient experimental results indicate that, SLA can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods and still maintain good deception effects when facing various defense methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research in hate speech detection has primarily centered on text-based media, largely overlooking multimodal content such as videos. Existing studies on hateful video datasets have predominantly focused on English content within a Western context and have been limited to binary labels (hateful or non-hateful), lacking detailed contextual information. This study presents MultiHateClip1 , an novel multilingual dataset created through hate lexicons and human annotation. It aims to enhance the detection of hateful videos on platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili, including content in both English and Chinese languages. Comprising 2,000 videos annotated for hatefulness, offensiveness, and normalcy, this dataset provides a cross-cultural perspective on gender-based hate speech. Through a detailed examination of human annotation results, we discuss the differences between Chinese and English hateful videos and underscore the importance of different modalities in hateful and offensive video analysis. Evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification models, such as VLM, GPT-4V and Qwen-VL, on MultiHateClip highlight the existing challenges in accurately distinguishing between hateful and offensive content and the urgent need for models that are both multimodally and culturally nuanced. MultiHateClip represents a foundational advance in enhancing hateful video detection by underscoring the necessity of a multimodal and culturally sensitive approach in combating online hate speech.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Activated Muscle Group Estimation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00952v5)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the new task of video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation (AMGE) aiming at identifying active muscle regions during physical activity in the wild. To this intent, we provide the MuscleMap dataset featuring >15K video clips with 135 different activities and 20 labeled muscle groups. This dataset opens the vistas to multiple video-based applications in sports and rehabilitation medicine under flexible environment constraints. The proposed MuscleMap dataset is constructed with YouTube videos, specifically targeting High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) physical exercise in the wild. To make the AMGE model applicable in real-life situations, it is crucial to ensure that the model can generalize well to numerous types of physical activities not present during training and involving new combinations of activated muscles. To achieve this, our benchmark also covers an evaluation setting where the model is exposed to activity types excluded from the training set. Our experiments reveal that the generalizability of existing architectures adapted for the AMGE task remains a challenge. Therefore, we also propose a new approach, TransM3E, which employs a multi-modality feature fusion mechanism between both the video transformer model and the skeleton-based graph convolution model with novel cross-modal knowledge distillation executed on multi-classification tokens. The proposed method surpasses all popular video classification models when dealing with both, previously seen and new types of physical activities.

| **[VidModEx: Interpretable and Efficient Black Box Model Extraction for High-Dimensional Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02140v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of black-box model extraction, conventional methods reliant on soft labels or surrogate datasets struggle with scaling to high-dimensional input spaces and managing the complexity of an extensive array of interrelated classes. In this work, we present a novel approach that utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance synthetic data generation. SHAP quantifies the individual contributions of each input feature towards the victim model's output, facilitating the optimization of an energy-based GAN towards a desirable output. This method significantly boosts performance, achieving a 16.45% increase in the accuracy of image classification models and extending to video classification models with an average improvement of 26.11% and a maximum of 33.36% on challenging datasets such as UCF11, UCF101, Kinetics 400, Kinetics 600, and Something-Something V2. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method under various scenarios, including the availability of top-k prediction probabilities, top-k prediction labels, and top-1 labels.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniForensics: Face Forgery Detection via General Facial Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19079v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous deepfake detection methods mostly depend on low-level textural features vulnerable to perturbations and fall short of detecting unseen forgery methods. In contrast, high-level semantic features are less susceptible to perturbations and not limited to forgery-specific artifacts, thus having stronger generalization. Motivated by this, we propose a detection method that utilizes high-level semantic features of faces to identify inconsistencies in temporal domain. We introduce UniForensics, a novel deepfake detection framework that leverages a transformer-based video classification network, initialized with a meta-functional face encoder for enriched facial representation. In this way, we can take advantage of both the powerful spatio-temporal model and the high-level semantic information of faces. Furthermore, to leverage easily accessible real face data and guide the model in focusing on spatio-temporal features, we design a Dynamic Video Self-Blending (DVSB) method to efficiently generate training samples with diverse spatio-temporal forgery traces using real facial videos. Based on this, we advance our framework with a two-stage training approach: The first stage employs a novel self-supervised contrastive learning, where we encourage the network to focus on forgery traces by impelling videos generated by the same forgery process to have similar representations. On the basis of the representation learned in the first stage, the second stage involves fine-tuning on face forgery detection dataset to build a deepfake detector. Extensive experiments validates that UniForensics outperforms existing face forgery methods in generalization ability and robustness. In particular, our method achieves 95.3\% and 77.2\% cross dataset AUC on the challenging Celeb-DFv2 and DFDC respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LookupViT: Compressing visual information to a limited number of tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12753v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions. But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant. In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost. LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens. These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers. Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches. LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model. We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder. LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |
| **[Learning Natural Consistency Representation for Face Forgery Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10550v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Forgery videos have elicited critical social public concerns and various detectors have been proposed. However, fully-supervised detectors may lead to easily overfitting to specific forgery methods or videos, and existing self-supervised detectors are strict on auxiliary tasks, such as requiring audio or multi-modalities, leading to limited generalization and robustness. In this paper, we examine whether we can address this issue by leveraging visual-only real face videos. To this end, we propose to learn the Natural Consistency representation (NACO) of real face videos in a self-supervised manner, which is inspired by the observation that fake videos struggle to maintain the natural spatiotemporal consistency even under unknown forgery methods and different perturbations. Our NACO first extracts spatial features of each frame by CNNs then integrates them into Transformer to learn the long-range spatiotemporal representation, leveraging the advantages of CNNs and Transformer on local spatial receptive field and long-term memory respectively. Furthermore, a Spatial Predictive Module~(SPM) and a Temporal Contrastive Module~(TCM) are introduced to enhance the natural consistency representation learning. The SPM aims to predict random masked spatial features from spatiotemporal representation, and the TCM regularizes the latent distance of spatiotemporal representation by shuffling the natural order to disturb the consistency, which could both force our NACO more sensitive to the natural spatiotemporal consistency. After the representation learning stage, a MLP head is fine-tuned to perform the usual forgery video classification task. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art competitors with impressive generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ToxVidLM: A Multimodal Framework for Toxicity Detection in Code-Mixed Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20628v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era of rapidly evolving internet technology, the surge in multimodal content, including videos, has expanded the horizons of online communication. However, the detection of toxic content in this diverse landscape, particularly in low-resource code-mixed languages, remains a critical challenge. While substantial research has addressed toxic content detection in textual data, the realm of video content, especially in non-English languages, has been relatively underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing a benchmark dataset, the first of its kind, consisting of 931 videos with 4021 code-mixed Hindi-English utterances collected from YouTube. Each utterance within this dataset has been meticulously annotated for toxicity, severity, and sentiment labels. We have developed an advanced Multimodal Multitask framework built for Toxicity detection in Video Content by leveraging Language Models (LMs), crafted for the primary objective along with the additional tasks of conducting sentiment and severity analysis. ToxVidLM incorporates three key modules - the Encoder module, Cross-Modal Synchronization module, and Multitask module - crafting a generic multimodal LM customized for intricate video classification tasks. Our experiments reveal that incorporating multiple modalities from the videos substantially enhances the performance of toxic content detection by achieving an Accuracy and Weighted F1 score of 94.29% and 94.35%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Long Paper in ACL Findings 2024.

Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in deep learning-based deepfake detection methods, particularly with diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, there is a growing demand for real-world applications to detect unseen individuals, deepfake techniques, and scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a Prototype-based Unified Framework for Deepfake Detection (PUDD). PUDD offers a detection system based on similarity, comparing input data against known prototypes for video classification and identifying potential deepfakes or previously unseen classes by analyzing drops in similarity. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) PUDD achieves an accuracy of 95.1% on Celeb-DF, outperforming state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods; (2) PUDD leverages image classification as the upstream task during training, demonstrating promising performance in both image classification and deepfake detection tasks during inference; (3) PUDD requires only 2.7 seconds for retraining on new data and emits 10$^{5}$ times less carbon compared to the state-of-the-art model, making it significantly more environmentally friendly.</p></details> | CVPR2024 | None |

The latter is often driven by the need to identify rapidly potential critical or dangerous situations. These could include machine failure, traffic accidents, heart problems, or dangerous behavior. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this, we present \our{}, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for dealing with the online classification problem for video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a robust mathematical foundation for the theory of classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return an outcome much faster. The subsequent phase is to demonstrate a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to online and recurrent operations. Finally, by comparing the proposed approach to the non-online state-of-the-art baseline, it is demonstrated that the use of \our{} encourages the network to make earlier classification decisions without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DL-KDD: Dual-Light Knowledge Distillation for Action Recognition in the Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02468v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action recognition in dark videos is a challenging task for computer vision. Recent research focuses on applying dark enhancement methods to improve the visibility of the video. However, such video processing results in the loss of critical information in the original (un-enhanced) video. Conversely, traditional two-stream methods are capable of learning information from both original and processed videos, but it can lead to a significant increase in the computational cost during the inference phase in the task of video classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel teacher-student video classification framework, named Dual-Light KnowleDge Distillation for Action Recognition in the Dark (DL-KDD). This framework enables the model to learn from both original and enhanced video without introducing additional computational cost during inference. Specifically, DL-KDD utilizes the strategy of knowledge distillation during training. The teacher model is trained with enhanced video, and the student model is trained with both the original video and the soft target generated by the teacher model. This teacher-student framework allows the student model to predict action using only the original input video during inference. In our experiments, the proposed DL-KDD framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the ARID, ARID V1.5, and Dark-48 datasets. We achieve the best performance on each dataset and up to a 4.18% improvement on Dark-48, using only original video inputs, thus avoiding the use of two-stream framework or enhancement modules for inference. We further validate the effectiveness of the distillation strategy in ablative experiments. The results highlight the advantages of our knowledge distillation framework in dark human action recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised learning method called SIAVC for industrial accident video classification. Specifically, we design a video augmentation module called the Super Augmentation Block (SAB). SAB adds Gaussian noise and randomly masks video frames according to historical loss on the unlabeled data for model optimization. Then, we propose a Video Cross-set Augmentation Module (VCAM) to generate diverse pseudo-label samples from the high-confidence unlabeled samples, which alleviates the mismatch of sampling experience and provides high-quality training data. Additionally, we construct a new industrial accident surveillance video dataset with frame-level annotation, namely ECA9, to evaluate our proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning based methods, SIAVC demonstrates outstanding video classification performance, achieving 88.76\% and 89.13\% accuracy on ECA9 and Fire Detection datasets, respectively. The source code and the constructed dataset ECA9 will be released in \url{https://github.com/AlchemyEmperor/SIAVC}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/AlchemyEmperor/SIAVC) |

Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |

Current black-box attacks need a large number of queries to succeed, resulting in high computational overhead in the process of attack. On the other hand, attacks with restricted perturbations are ineffective against defenses such as denoising or adversarial training. In this paper, we focus on unrestricted perturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via style transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first utilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps avoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class confidence is additionally considered in targeted attacks to influence the output distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or even across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to further optimize the adversarial perturbations. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51. The experimental results demonstrate that StyleFool outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both the number of queries and the robustness against existing defenses. Moreover, 50% of the stylized videos in untargeted attacks do not need any query since they can already fool the video classification model. Furthermore, we evaluate the indistinguishability through a user study to show that the adversarial samples of StyleFool look imperceptible to human eyes, despite unrestricted perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures.

However, the adaptation of these models to egocentric videos has been largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet effective cross-modal adaptation framework, which we call X-MIC. Using a video adapter, our pipeline learns to align frozen text embeddings to each egocentric video directly in the shared embedding space. Our novel adapter architecture retains and improves generalization of the pre-trained VLMs by disentangling learnable temporal modeling and frozen visual encoder. This results in an enhanced alignment of text embeddings to each egocentric video, leading to a significant improvement in cross-dataset generalization. We evaluate our approach on the Epic-Kitchens, Ego4D, and EGTEA datasets for fine-grained cross-dataset action generalization, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

In this work, we release yet another sports video benchmark \TheName{} for \emph{\underline{P}}ing \emph{\underline{P}}ong-\emph{\underline{A}}ction detection, which consists of 2,721 video clips collected from the broadcasting videos of professional table tennis matches in World Table Tennis Championships and Olympiads. We work with a crew of table tennis professionals and referees on a specially designed annotation toolbox to obtain fine-grained action labels (in 14 classes) for every ping-pong action that appeared in the dataset, and formulate two sets of action detection problems -- \emph{action localization} and \emph{action recognition}. We evaluate a number of commonly-seen action recognition (e.g., TSM, TSN, Video SwinTransformer, and Slowfast) and action localization models (e.g., BSN, BSN++, BMN, TCANet), using \TheName{} for both problems, under various settings. These models can only achieve 48\% area under the AR-AN curve for localization and 82\% top-one accuracy for recognition since the ping-pong actions are dense with fast-moving subjects but broadcasting videos are with only 25 FPS. The results confirm that \TheName{} is still a challenging task and can be used as a special benchmark for dense action detection from videos.</p></details> |  | None |

Thus, the development of applications can assist breeders in making decisions to improve production performance and reduce costs, once the animal behavior is analyzed by humans and this can lead to susceptible errors and time consumption. Aggressiveness in pigs is an example of behavior that is studied to reduce its impact through animal classification and identification. However, this process is laborious and susceptible to errors, which can be reduced through automation by visually classifying videos captured in controlled environment. The captured videos can be used for training and, as a result, for classification through computer vision and artificial intelligence, employing neural network techniques. The main techniques utilized in this study are variants of transformers: STAM, TimeSformer, and ViViT, as well as techniques using convolutions, such as ResNet3D2, Resnet(2+1)D, and CnnLstm. These techniques were employed for pig video classification with the objective of identifying aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors. In this work, various techniques were compared to analyze the contribution of using transformers, in addition to the effectiveness of the convolution technique in video classification. The performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall. The TimerSformer technique showed the best results in video classification, with median accuracy of 0.729.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the majority of current face manipulation methods generate fake faces based on a single frame, which do not take frame consistency and coordination into consideration, artifacts on frame sequences are more effective for face forgery detection. However, current sequence-based face forgery detection methods use general video classification networks directly, which discard the special and discriminative motion information for face manipulation detection. To this end, we propose an effective sequence-based forgery detection framework based on an existing video classification method. To make the motion features more expressive for manipulation detection, we propose an alternative motion consistency block instead of the original motion features module. To make the learned features more generalizable, we propose an auxiliary anomaly detection block. With these two specially designed improvements, we make a general video classification network achieve promising results on three popular face forgery datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2023</p></details> | None |

We also present two baseline methods for handover failure detection: (i) a video classification method using 3D CNNs and (ii) a temporal action segmentation approach which jointly classifies the human action, robot action and overall outcome of the action. The results show that video is an important modality, but using force-torque data and gripper position help improve failure detection and action segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-modality transrectal ultrasound video classification for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08987v2)** | 2024-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in the world. Recently, multi-modality transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has increasingly become an effective tool for the guidance of prostate biopsies. With the aim of effectively identifying prostate cancer, we propose a framework for the classification of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) from multi-modality TRUS videos. The framework utilizes two 3D ResNet-50 models to extract features from B-mode images and shear wave elastography images, respectively. An adaptive spatial fusion module is introduced to aggregate two modalities' features. An orthogonal regularized loss is further used to mitigate feature redundancy. The proposed framework is evaluated on an in-house dataset containing 512 TRUS videos, and achieves favorable performance in identifying csPCa with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.84. Furthermore, the visualized class activation mapping (CAM) images generated from the proposed framework may provide valuable guidance for the localization of csPCa, thus facilitating the TRUS-guided targeted biopsy. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/2313595986/ProstateTRUS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/2313595986/ProstateTRUS) |
| **[Video Annotator: A framework for efficiently building video classifiers using vision-language models and active learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06560v1)** | 2024-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality and consistent annotations are fundamental to the successful development of robust machine learning models. Traditional data annotation methods are resource-intensive and inefficient, often leading to a reliance on third-party annotators who are not the domain experts. Hard samples, which are usually the most informative for model training, tend to be difficult to label accurately and consistently without business context. These can arise unpredictably during the annotation process, requiring a variable number of iterations and rounds of feedback, leading to unforeseen expenses and time commitments to guarantee quality. We posit that more direct involvement of domain experts, using a human-in-the-loop system, can resolve many of these practical challenges. We propose a novel framework we call Video Annotator (VA) for annotating, managing, and iterating on video classification datasets. Our approach offers a new paradigm for an end-user-centered model development process, enhancing the efficiency, usability, and effectiveness of video classifiers. Uniquely, VA allows for a continuous annotation process, seamlessly integrating data collection and model training. We leverage the zero-shot capabilities of vision-language foundation models combined with active learning techniques, and demonstrate that VA enables the efficient creation of high-quality models. VA achieves a median 6.8 point improvement in Average Precision relative to the most competitive baseline across a wide-ranging assortment of tasks. We release a dataset with 153k labels across 56 video understanding tasks annotated by three professional video editors using VA, and also release code to replicate our experiments at: http://github.com/netflix/videoannotator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to KDD '24 (ADS Track)</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/netflix/videoannotator) |
| **[Time-, Memory- and Parameter-Efficient Visual Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02887v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models become more popular, there is a growing need to efficiently finetune them for downstream tasks. Although numerous adaptation methods have been proposed, they are designed to be efficient only in terms of how many parameters are trained. They, however, typically still require backpropagating gradients throughout the model, meaning that their training-time and -memory cost does not reduce as significantly. We propose an adaptation method which does not backpropagate gradients through the backbone. We achieve this by designing a lightweight network in parallel that operates on features from the frozen, pretrained backbone. As a result, our method is efficient not only in terms of parameters, but also in training-time and memory usage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-parameter trade-offs on the popular VTAB benchmark, and we further show how we outperform prior works with respect to training-time and -memory usage too. We further demonstrate the training efficiency and scalability of our method by adapting a vision transformer backbone of 4 billion parameters for the computationally demanding task of video classification, without any intricate model parallelism. Here, we outperform a prior adaptor-based method which could only scale to a 1 billion parameter backbone, or fully-finetuning a smaller backbone, with the same GPU and less training time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the progress in vision and vision-language foundation models, which are also critical elements of multi-modal AGI, has not kept pace with LLMs. In this work, we design a large-scale vision-language foundation model (InternVL), which scales up the vision foundation model to 6 billion parameters and progressively aligns it with the LLM, using web-scale image-text data from various sources. This model can be broadly applied to and achieve state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks including visual perception tasks such as image-level or pixel-level recognition, vision-language tasks such as zero-shot image/video classification, zero-shot image/video-text retrieval, and link with LLMs to create multi-modal dialogue systems. It has powerful visual capabilities and can be a good alternative to the ViT-22B. We hope that our research could contribute to the development of multi-modal large models.

However, how to effectively leverage the two modalities is still under development. In this work, we develop a multiscale multimodal Transformer (MMT) that leverages hierarchical representation learning. Particularly, MMT is composed of a novel multiscale audio Transformer (MAT) and a multiscale video Transformer [43]. To learn a discriminative cross-modality fusion, we further design multimodal supervised contrastive objectives called audio-video contrastive loss (AVC) and intra-modal contrastive loss (IMC) that robustly align the two modalities. MMT surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches by 7.3% and 2.1% on Kinetics-Sounds and VGGSound in terms of the top-1 accuracy without external training data. Moreover, the proposed MAT significantly outperforms AST [28] by 22.2%, 4.4% and 4.7% on three public benchmark datasets, and is about 3% more efficient based on the number of FLOPs and 9.8% more efficient based on GPU memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2024; well-formatted PDF is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Zo_ydJZFAm7YsxHDgTjhyc4dEJbW_dk/view?usp=sharing</p></details> | None |

To learn from multimodal videos effectively, in this work, we propose a novel audio-video recognition approach termed audio video Transformer, AVT, leveraging the effective spatio-temporal representation by the video Transformer to improve action recognition accuracy. For multimodal fusion, simply concatenating multimodal tokens in a cross-modal Transformer requires large computational and memory resources, instead we reduce the cross-modality complexity through an audio-video bottleneck Transformer. To improve the learning efficiency of multimodal Transformer, we integrate self-supervised objectives, i.e., audio-video contrastive learning, audio-video matching, and masked audio and video learning, into AVT training, which maps diverse audio and video representations into a common multimodal representation space. We further propose a masked audio segment loss to learn semantic audio activities in AVT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three public datasets and two in-house datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AVT. Specifically, AVT outperforms its previous state-of-the-art counterparts on Kinetics-Sounds by 8%. AVT also surpasses one of the previous state-of-the-art video Transformers [25] by 10% on VGGSound by leveraging the audio signal. Compared to one of the previous state-of-the-art multimodal methods, MBT [32], AVT is 1.3% more efficient in terms of FLOPs and improves the accuracy by 3.8% on Epic-Kitchens-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2024; well-formatted PDF is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvW52lamsvNGMCqPS7q8g8L4NaR_LlbR/view?usp=sharing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.04023</p></details> | None |
| **[Revisiting Foreground and Background Separation in Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization: A Clustering-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14138v1)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to localize action instances in videos with only video-level action labels. Existing methods mainly embrace a localization-by-classification pipeline that optimizes the snippet-level prediction with a video classification loss. However, this formulation suffers from the discrepancy between classification and detection, resulting in inaccurate separation of foreground and background (F\&B) snippets. To alleviate this problem, we propose to explore the underlying structure among the snippets by resorting to unsupervised snippet clustering, rather than heavily relying on the video classification loss. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering-based F\&B separation algorithm. It comprises two core components: a snippet clustering component that groups the snippets into multiple latent clusters and a cluster classification component that further classifies the cluster as foreground or background. As there are no ground-truth labels to train these two components, we introduce a unified self-labeling mechanism based on optimal transport to produce high-quality pseudo-labels that match several plausible prior distributions. This ensures that the cluster assignments of the snippets can be accurately associated with their F\&B labels, thereby boosting the F\&B separation. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks: THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.2 and v1.3. Our method achieves promising performance on all three benchmarks while being significantly more lightweight than previous methods.

Previous work based on mask autoencoders such as ImageMAE and VideoMAE has proven the effectiveness of learning representations in images and videos through reconstruction strategy in the visual modality. However, these models exhibit inherent limitations, particularly in scenarios where extracting features solely from the visual modality proves challenging, such as when dealing with low-resolution and blurry original videos. Based on this, we propose AV-MaskEnhancer for learning high-quality video representation by combining visual and audio information. Our approach addresses the challenge by demonstrating the complementary nature of audio and video features in cross-modality content. Moreover, our result of the video classification task on the UCF101 dataset outperforms the existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art, with a top-1 accuracy of 98.8% and a top-5 accuracy of 99.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 35th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)</p></details> | None |

IMP integrates multimodal inputs including image, video, text, and audio into a single Transformer encoder with minimal modality-specific components. IMP makes use of a novel design that combines Alternating Gradient Descent (AGD) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for efficient model and task scaling. We conduct extensive empirical studies and reveal the following key insights: 1) Performing gradient descent updates by alternating on diverse modalities, loss functions, and tasks, with varying input resolutions, efficiently improves the model. 2) Sparsification with MoE on a single modality-agnostic encoder substantially improves the performance, outperforming dense models that use modality-specific encoders or additional fusion layers and greatly mitigates the conflicts between modalities. IMP achieves competitive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks including video classification, image classification, image-text, and video-text retrieval. Most notably, we train a sparse IMP-MoE-L variant focusing on video tasks that achieves new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video classification: 77.0% on Kinetics-400, 76.8% on Kinetics-600, and 68.3% on Kinetics-700, improving the previous state-of-the-art by +5%, +6.7%, and +5.8%, respectively, while using only 15% of their total training computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

This is challenging, as resources are often limited in real-world driving scenarios. This paper introduces a lightweight framework for resource-efficient driver activity recognition. The framework enhances 3D MobileNet, a neural architecture optimized for speed in video classification, by incorporating knowledge distillation and model quantization to balance model accuracy and computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation helps maintain accuracy while reducing the model size by leveraging soft labels from a larger teacher model (I3D), instead of relying solely on original ground truth data. Model quantization significantly lowers memory and computation demands by using lower precision integers for model weights and activations. Extensive testing on a public dataset for in-vehicle monitoring during autonomous driving demonstrates that this new framework achieves a threefold reduction in model size and a 1.4-fold improvement in inference time, compared to an already optimized architecture.

Prior work has typically addressed this task by adapting models from traditional video classification tasks, such as action recognition or event detection. However, these models often neglect language elements (e.g., narrations or conversations) present in videos, which can implicitly convey high-level semantics of movie genres, like storylines or background context. Additionally, existing approaches are primarily designed to encode the entire content of the input video, leading to inefficiencies in predicting movie genres. Movie genre prediction may require only a few shots to accurately determine the genres, rendering a comprehensive understanding of the entire video unnecessary. To address these challenges, we propose a Movie genre Classification method based on Language augmentatIon and shot samPling (Movie-CLIP). Movie-CLIP mainly consists of two parts: a language augmentation module to recognize language elements from the input audio, and a shot sampling module to select representative shots from the entire video. We evaluate our method on MovieNet and Condensed Movies datasets, achieving approximate 6-9% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over the baselines. We also generalize Movie-CLIP to the scene boundary detection task, achieving 1.1% improvement in Average Precision (AP) over the state-of-the-art.

First, our STDN proposes to discover various types of spatial cues within individual frames by spatial grouping.

In this paper, we challenge this modality-complete assumption for multimodal learning and instead strive for generalization to unseen modality combinations during inference. We pose the problem of unseen modality interaction and introduce a first solution. It exploits a module that projects the multidimensional features of different modalities into a common space with rich information preserved. This allows the information to be accumulated with a simple summation operation across available modalities. To reduce overfitting to less discriminative modality combinations during training, we further improve the model learning with pseudo-supervision indicating the reliability of a modality's prediction.

A common approach to process long videos is applying a short-form video model over uniformly sampled clips of fixed temporal length and aggregating the outputs. This approach neglects the underlying nature of long videos since fixed-length clips are often redundant or uninformative. In this paper, we aim to provide a generic and adaptive sampling approach for long-form videos in lieu of the de facto uniform sampling. Viewing videos as semantically consistent segments, we formulate a task-agnostic, unsupervised, and scalable approach based on Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) for sampling and tokenizing long videos. We evaluate our method on long-form video understanding tasks such as video classification and temporal action localization, showing consistent gains over existing approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-form video modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Going beyond existing methods that emphasize simple activities or objects, we propose a new model-agnostic approach for generating detailed textual descriptions that captures multimodal video information. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge learnt by large language models, such as GPT-3.5 or Llama2, to reason about textual descriptions of the visual and aural modalities, obtained from BLIP-2, Whisper and ImageBind. Without needing additional finetuning of video-text models or datasets, we demonstrate that available LLMs have the ability to use these multimodal textual descriptions as proxies for ``sight'' or ``hearing'' and perform zero-shot multimodal classification of videos in-context. Our evaluations on popular action recognition benchmarks, such as UCF-101 or Kinetics, show these context-rich descriptions can be successfully used in video understanding tasks. This method points towards a promising new research direction in multimodal classification, demonstrating how an interplay between textual, visual and auditory machine learning models can enable more holistic video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at "What is Next in Multimodal Foundation Models?"

Some existing methods achieve high efficiency by explicit discard of spatial or temporal information, which poses challenges in fast-changing and fine-grained scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an efficient video representation network with Differentiable Resolution Compression and Alignment mechanism, which compresses non-essential information in the early stage of the network to reduce computational costs while maintaining consistent temporal correlations. Specifically, we leverage a Differentiable Context-aware Compression Module to encode the saliency and non-saliency frame features, refining and updating the features into a high-low resolution video sequence. To process the new sequence, we introduce a new Resolution-Align Transformer Layer to capture global temporal correlations among frame features with different resolutions, while reducing spatial computation costs quadratically by utilizing fewer spatial tokens in low-resolution non-saliency frames. The entire network can be end-to-end optimized via the integration of the differentiable compression module. Experimental results show that our method achieves the best trade-off between efficiency and performance on near-duplicate video retrieval and competitive results on dynamic video classification compared to state-of-the-art methods.

A challenging and underexplored, yet much cheaper, setup is few-shot learning from video data. In particular, the inherently multi-modal nature of video data with sound and visual information has not been leveraged extensively for the few-shot video classification task. Therefore, we introduce a unified audio-visual few-shot video classification benchmark on three datasets, i.e. the VGGSound-FSL, UCF-FSL, ActivityNet-FSL datasets, where we adapt and compare ten methods. In addition, we propose AV-DIFF, a text-to-feature diffusion framework, which first fuses the temporal and audio-visual features via cross-modal attention and then generates multi-modal features for the novel classes. We show that AV-DIFF obtains state-of-the-art performance on our proposed benchmark for audio-visual (generalised) few-shot learning. Our benchmark paves the way for effective audio-visual classification when only limited labeled data is available.

On the other hand, 3D convolutional networks have been successfully applied for video classification tasks, but have not been leveraged as effectively to problems involving dense per-pixel interpretation of videos compared to their 2D convolutional counterparts and lag behind the aforementioned networks in terms of performance. In this work, we show that 3D CNNs can be effectively applied to dense video prediction tasks such as salient object segmentation. We propose a simple yet effective encoder-decoder network architecture consisting entirely of 3D convolutions that can be trained end-to-end using a standard cross-entropy loss. To this end, we leverage an efficient 3D encoder, and propose a 3D decoder architecture, that comprises novel 3D Global Convolution layers and 3D Refinement modules. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin on the DAVIS'16 Unsupervised, FBMS and ViSal dataset benchmarks in addition to being faster, thus showing that our architecture can efficiently learn expressive spatio-temporal features and produce high quality video segmentation masks.

The key idea here is to occlude a specific volume of data by a 3D mask in an input 3D temporal-spatial data space and then measure the change degree in the output score. The occluded volume data that produces a larger change degree is regarded as a more critical element for classification. However, while the occlusion sensitivity analysis is commonly used to analyze single image classification, applying this idea to video classification is not so straightforward as a simple fixed cuboid cannot deal with complicated motions. To solve this issue, we adaptively set the shape of a 3D occlusion mask while referring to motions. Our flexible mask adaptation is performed by considering the temporal continuity and spatial co-occurrence of the optical flows extracted from the input video data. We further propose a novel method to reduce the computational cost of the proposed method with the first-order approximation of the output score with respect to an input video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various and extensive comparisons with the conventional methods in terms of the deletion/insertion metric and the pointing metric on the UCF101 dataset and the Kinetics-400 and 700 datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for video classification, focusing on the veracity of the content. We convert the conventional video classification task into a text classification task by leveraging the textual content derived from the video transcripts. We employ advanced machine learning techniques like transfer learning to solve the classification challenge. Our approach incorporates two forms of transfer learning: (a) fine-tuning base transformer models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA, and (b) few-shot learning using sentence-transformers MPNet and RoBERTa-large. We apply the trained models to three datasets: (a) YouTube Vaccine-misinformation related videos, (b) YouTube Pseudoscience videos, and (c) Fake-News dataset (a collection of articles).

| **[The Staged Knowledge Distillation in Video Classification: Harmonizing Student Progress by a Complementary Weakly Supervised Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05201v3)** | 2023-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of label-efficient learning on video data, the distillation method and the structural design of the teacher-student architecture have a significant impact on knowledge distillation. However, the relationship between these factors has been overlooked in previous research. To address this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised learning framework for knowledge distillation in video classification that is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the student model. Our approach leverages the concept of substage-based learning to distill knowledge based on the combination of student substages and the correlation of corresponding substages. We also employ the progressive cascade training method to address the accuracy loss caused by the large capacity gap between the teacher and the student. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-label optimization strategy to improve the initial data label. To optimize the loss functions of different distillation substages during the training process, we introduce a new loss method based on feature distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and simulated data sets, demonstrating that our proposed approach outperforms existing distillation methods in terms of knowledge distillation for video classification tasks. Our proposed substage-based distillation approach has the potential to inform future research on label-efficient learning for video data.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a cost-effective and non-invasive imaging technique and has become more and more frequently used for renal tumor diagnosis. However, the classification of benign and malignant renal tumors can still be very challenging due to the highly heterogeneous appearance of cancer and imaging artifacts. Our aim is to detect and classify renal tumors by integrating B-mode and CEUS-mode ultrasound videos. To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal ultrasound video fusion network that can effectively perform multi-modal feature fusion and video classification for renal tumor diagnosis. The attention-based multi-modal fusion module uses cross-attention and self-attention to extract modality-invariant features and modality-specific features in parallel. In addition, we design an object-level temporal aggregation (OTA) module that can automatically filter low-quality features and efficiently integrate temporal information from multiple frames to improve the accuracy of tumor diagnosis. Experimental results on a multicenter dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms the single-modal models and the competing methods. Furthermore, our OTA module achieves higher classification accuracy than the frame-level predictions.

However, models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) offer flexible sequence-based modeling, and hence varying input sequence lengths. We take advantage of this with NaViT (Native Resolution ViT) which uses sequence packing during training to process inputs of arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. Alongside flexible model usage, we demonstrate improved training efficiency for large-scale supervised and contrastive image-text pretraining. NaViT can be efficiently transferred to standard tasks such as image and video classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation and leads to improved results on robustness and fairness benchmarks. At inference time, the input resolution flexibility can be used to smoothly navigate the test-time cost-performance trade-off. We believe that NaViT marks a departure from the standard, CNN-designed, input and modelling pipeline used by most computer vision models, and represents a promising direction for ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Active Learning for Video Classification with Frame Level Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05587v1)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning algorithms have pushed the boundaries of computer vision research and have depicted commendable performance in a variety of applications. However, training a robust deep neural network necessitates a large amount of labeled training data, acquiring which involves significant time and human effort. This problem is even more serious for an application like video classification, where a human annotator has to watch an entire video end-to-end to furnish a label. Active learning algorithms automatically identify the most informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data; this tremendously reduces the human annotation effort in inducing a machine learning model, as only the few samples that are identified by the algorithm, need to be labeled manually. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning framework for video classification, with the goal of further reducing the labeling onus on the human annotators. Our framework identifies a batch of exemplar videos, together with a set of informative frames for each video; the human annotator needs to merely review the frames and provide a label for each video. This involves much less manual work than watching the complete video to come up with a label. We formulate a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the informative videos and exploit representative sampling techniques to extract a set of exemplar frames from each video. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to develop an active learning framework for video classification, where the annotators need to inspect only a few frames to produce a label, rather than watching the end-to-end video.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the pipeline is time-consuming and tough due to the ambiguous boundaries of plaque and temporal variation. To automatize this procedure, a large number of manual delineations are usually required, which is not only laborious but also not reliable given the annotation difficulty. In this study, we present the first video classification framework for automatic CSG. Our contribution is three-fold. First, to avoid the requirement of laborious and unreliable annotation, we propose a novel and effective video classification network for weakly-supervised CSG. Second, to ease the model training, we adopt an inflation strategy for the network, where pre-trained 2D convolution weights can be adapted into the 3D counterpart in our network for an effective warm start. Third, to enhance the feature discrimination of the video, we propose a novel attention-guided multi-dimension fusion (AMDF) transformer encoder to model and integrate global dependencies within and across spatial and temporal dimensions, where two lightweight cross-dimensional attention mechanisms are designed. Our approach is extensively validated on a large clinically collected carotid US video dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared with strong competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[A Unified Multimodal De- and Re-coupling Framework for RGB-D Motion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09146v2)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion recognition is a promising direction in computer vision, but the training of video classification models is much harder than images due to insufficient data and considerable parameters. To get around this, some works strive to explore multimodal cues from RGB-D data. Although improving motion recognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D datasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data augmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the tightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to spatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion, i.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations caused to insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve RGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in this paper. In more detail, firstly, we introduce a novel video data augmentation method dubbed ShuffleMix, which acts as a supplement to MixUp, to provide additional temporal regularization for motion recognition. Secondly, a Unified Multimodal De-coupling and multi-stage Re-coupling framework, termed UMDR, is proposed for video representation learning. Finally, a novel cross-modal Complement Feature Catcher (CFCer) is explored to mine potential commonalities features in multimodal information as the auxiliary fusion stream, to improve the late fusion results. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust spatiotemporal representation and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets. Specifically, UMDR achieves unprecedented improvements of +4.5% on the Chalearn IsoGD dataset.

However, the collection of ultrasound video datasets is much harder. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of enhancing the performance of ultrasound video classification using the static image dataset. To this end, we propose KGA-Net and coherence loss. The KGA-Net adopts both video clips and static images to train the network. The coherence loss uses the feature centers generated by the static images to guide the frame attention in the video model. Our KGA-Net boosts the performance on the public BUSV dataset by a large margin. The visualization results of frame attention prove the explainability of our method.

| **[UniFormer: Unifying Convolution and Self-attention for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09450v3)** | 2023-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging task to learn discriminative representation from images and videos, due to large local redundancy and complex global dependency in these visual data. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can efficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small neighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global dependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency via self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens lead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified transFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from the typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block are equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and deep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient and effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer blocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from image to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any extra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification. With only ImageNet-1K pre-training, it can simply achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of downstream tasks, e.g., it obtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2 top-1 accuracy on Sth-Sth V1/V2 video classification, 53.8 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on COCO object detection, 50.8 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 77.4 AP on COCO pose estimation.

The inspection process consists of a manual video analysis which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To address this, we propose an automatic video analysis system using deep learning and computer vision to improve upon existing methods that only consider spatial information on individual frames in underwater ship hull video inspection. By exploring the benefits of adding temporal information and analyzing frame-based classifiers, we propose a multi-label video classification model that exploits the self-attention mechanism of transformers to capture spatiotemporal attention in consecutive video frames. Our proposed method has demonstrated promising results and can serve as a benchmark for future research and development in underwater video inspection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at OCEANS 2023 Limerick conference and will be published by IEEE</p></details> | None |

Towards Effective Content Moderation for Children's Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15551v1)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video platforms receive hundreds of hours of uploads every minute, making manual content moderation impossible. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable consumers of malicious video content are children from ages 1-5 whose attention is easily captured by bursts of color and sound. Scammers attempting to monetize their content may craft malicious children's videos that are superficially similar to educational videos, but include scary and disgusting characters, violent motions, loud music, and disturbing noises. Prominent video hosting platforms like YouTube have taken measures to mitigate malicious content on their platform, but these videos often go undetected by current content moderation tools that are focused on removing pornographic or copyrighted content. This paper introduces our toolkit Malicious or Benign for promoting research on automated content moderation of children's videos. We present 1) a customizable annotation tool for videos, 2) a new dataset with difficult to detect test cases of malicious content and 3) a benchmark suite of state-of-the-art video classification models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, The 36th International FLAIRS Conference</p></details> | None |

Due to this, hate speech research has recently gained a lot of traction. However, most of the work has primarily focused on text media with relatively little work on images and even lesser on videos. Thus, early stage automated video moderation techniques are needed to handle the videos that are being uploaded to keep the platform safe and healthy. With a view to detect and remove hateful content from the video sharing platforms, our work focuses on hate video detection using multi-modalities. To this end, we curate ~43 hours of videos from BitChute and manually annotate them as hate or non-hate, along with the frame spans which could explain the labelling decision. To collect the relevant videos we harnessed search keywords from hate lexicons. We observe various cues in images and audio of hateful videos. Further, we build deep learning multi-modal models to classify the hate videos and observe that using all the modalities of the videos improves the overall hate speech detection performance (accuracy=0.798, macro F1-score=0.790) by ~5.7% compared to the best uni-modal model in terms of macro F1 score. In summary, our work takes the first step toward understanding and modeling hateful videos on video hosting platforms such as BitChute.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICWSM 2023(dataset track)</p></details> | None |

To train the system, we propose a two-phase training strategy. In the first training phase (Phase I), we extract the audio and visual (image) data from the original video. We then train the audio data and the visual data with independent deep learning based models. After the training processes, we obtain audio embeddings and visual embeddings by extracting feature maps from the pre-trained deep learning models. In the second training phase (Phase II), we train a fusion layer to combine the audio/visual embeddings and a dense layer to classify the combined embedding into target daily scenes. Our extensive experiments, which were conducted on the benchmark dataset of DCASE (IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events) 2021 Task 1B Development, achieved the best classification accuracy of 80.5%, 91.8%, and 95.3% with only audio data, with only visual data, both audio and visual data, respectively. The highest classification accuracy of 95.3% presents an improvement of 17.9% compared with DCASE baseline and shows very competitive to the state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Almost all recent approaches focus on how to select the correct snippets for training to improve the performance. They overlook or do not realize the power of video classification in boosting the performance of anomaly detection. In this paper, we study explicitly the power of video classification supervision using a BERT or LSTM. With this BERT or LSTM, CNN features of all snippets of a video can be aggregated into a single feature which can be used for video classification. This simple yet powerful video classification supervision, combined into the MIL framework, brings extraordinary performance improvement on all three major video anomaly detection datasets.

Recently, state-of-the-art video-language models based on CLIP have been shown to have limited verb understanding and to rely extensively on nouns, restricting their performance in real-world video applications that require action and temporal understanding. In this work, we improve verb understanding for CLIP-based video-language models by proposing a new Verb-Focused Contrastive (VFC) framework. This consists of two main components: (1) leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) to create hard negatives for cross-modal contrastive learning, together with a calibration strategy to balance the occurrence of concepts in positive and negative pairs; and (2) enforcing a fine-grained, verb phrase alignment loss. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results for zero-shot performance on three downstream tasks that focus on verb understanding: video-text matching, video question-answering and video classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which proposes a method to alleviate the verb understanding problem, and does not simply highlight it.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseFormer: Sparse Visual Recognition via Limited Latent Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03768v1)** | 2023-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human visual recognition is a sparse process, where only a few salient visual cues are attended to rather than traversing every detail uniformly. However, most current vision networks follow a dense paradigm, processing every single visual unit (e.g,, pixel or patch) in a uniform manner. In this paper, we challenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to imitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. SparseFormer learns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49) in the latent space with sparse feature sampling procedure instead of processing dense units in the original pixel space. Therefore, SparseFormer circumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower computational costs. Experiments on the ImageNet classification benchmark dataset show that SparseFormer achieves performance on par with canonical or well-established models while offering better accuracy-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the design of our network can be easily extended to the video classification with promising performance at lower computational costs. We hope that our work can provide an alternative way for visual modeling and inspire further research on sparse neural architectures.

However, recent works in this area face a trade-off. Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy. Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for supervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to model the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame discriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text side to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong zero-shot performance.

Deep learning-based video compression methods are rapidly replacing traditional algorithms and providing state-of-the-art results on edge devices.

In this work, we present a real-world LED attack to target video compression frameworks. Our physically realizable attack, dubbed NetFlick, can degrade the spatio-temporal correlation between successive frames by injecting flickering temporal perturbations. In addition, we propose universal perturbations that can downgrade performance of incoming video without prior knowledge of the contents.

Our method matches its semantic video representation, which is constructed with respect to frame importance scores, to a representation derived from a CNN trained on video classification. Empirical evaluations on correlation-based metrics, such as Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in assigning relative scores to the input frames.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

Along with the growth of computational capacity, we now have open-source vision-language pre-trained models in large scales of the model architecture and amount of data. In this study, we focus on transferring knowledge for video classification tasks. Conventional methods randomly initialize the linear classifier head for vision classification, but they leave the usage of the text encoder for downstream visual recognition tasks undiscovered. In this paper, we revise the role of the linear classifier and replace the classifier with the different knowledge from pre-trained model. We utilize the well-pretrained language model to generate good semantic target for efficient transferring learning. The empirical study shows that our method improves both the performance and the training speed of video classification, with a negligible change in the model. Our simple yet effective tuning paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficient training on various video recognition scenarios, i.e., zero-shot, few-shot, general recognition. In particular, our paradigm achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.8% on Kinetics-400, and also surpasses previous methods by 20~50% absolute top-1 accuracy under zero-shot, few-shot settings on five popular video datasets.

Recent advances have achieved great success in saving storage costs for various pre-trained models by updating a small number of parameters instead of full tuning. However, we notice that most existing PETL methods still incur non-negligible latency during inference. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient and computational friendly adapter for giant vision models, called RepAdapter. Specifically, we first prove that common adaptation modules can also be seamlessly integrated into most giant vision models via our structural re-parameterization, thereby achieving zero-cost during inference. We then investigate the sparse design and effective placement of adapter structure, helping our RepAdaper obtain other advantages in terms of parameter efficiency and performance. To validate RepAdapter, we conduct extensive experiments on 27 benchmark datasets of three vision tasks, i.e., image and video classifications and semantic segmentation. Experimental results show the superior performance and efficiency of RepAdapter than the state-of-the-art PETL methods. For instance, RepAdapter outperforms full tuning by +7.2% on average and saves up to 25% training time, 20% GPU memory, and 94.6% storage cost of ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1k. The generalization ability of RepAdapter is also well validated by a bunch of vision models.

Test-time optimization is an effective way that adapts models to generalize to corrupted data during testing, which has been shown in the image domain. However, the techniques for improving video classification corruption robustness remain few. In this work, we propose a Temporal Coherent Test-time Optimization framework (TeCo) to utilize spatio-temporal information in test-time optimization for robust video classification. To exploit information in video with self-supervised learning, TeCo uses global content from video clips and optimizes models for entropy minimization. TeCo minimizes the entropy of the prediction based on the global content from video clips. Meanwhile, it also feeds local content to regularize the temporal coherence at the feature level. TeCo retains the generalization ability of various video classification models and achieves significant improvements in corruption robustness across Mini Kinetics-C and Mini SSV2-C. Furthermore, TeCo sets a new baseline in video classification corruption robustness via test-time optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the high similarity between MRI data and videos, we conduct extensive empirical studies on video recognition techniques for MRI classification to answer the questions: (1) can we directly use video recognition models for MRI classification, (2) which model is more appropriate for MRI, (3) are the common tricks like data augmentation in video recognition still useful for MRI classification? Our work suggests that advanced video techniques benefit MRI classification. In this paper, four datasets of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease recognition are utilized in experiments, together with three alternative video recognition models and data augmentation techniques that are frequently applied to video tasks. In terms of efficiency, the results reveal that the video framework performs better than 3D-CNN models by 5% - 11% with 50% - 66% less trainable parameters. This report pushes forward the potential fusion of 3D medical imaging and video understanding research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI'23</p></details> | None |

Although CCTV cameras help a lot in increasing security, these systems require constant human interaction and monitoring. To eradicate this issue, intelligent surveillance systems can be built using deep learning video classification techniques that can help us automate surveillance systems to detect violence as it happens. In this research, we explore deep learning video classification techniques to detect violence as they are happening. Traditional image classification techniques fall short when it comes to classifying videos as they attempt to classify each frame separately for which the predictions start to flicker. Therefore, many researchers are coming up with video classification techniques that consider spatiotemporal features while classifying. However, deploying these deep learning models with methods such as skeleton points obtained through pose estimation and optical flow obtained through depth sensors, are not always practical in an IoT environment. Although these techniques ensure a higher accuracy score, they are computationally heavier. Keeping these constraints in mind, we experimented with various video classification and action recognition techniques such as ConvLSTM, LRCN (with both custom CNN layers and VGG-16 as feature extractor) CNNTransformer and C3D. We achieved a test accuracy of 80% on ConvLSTM, 83.33% on CNN-BiLSTM, 70% on VGG16-BiLstm ,76.76% on CNN-Transformer and 80% on C3D.</p></details> |  | None |

By decoupling the GPU memory requirement from the depth of the model, Reversible Vision Transformers enable scaling up architectures with efficient memory usage. We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and Multiscale Vision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image classification, object detection and video classification. Reversible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5x at roughly identical model complexity, parameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of reversible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for hardware resource limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the additional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where throughput can increase up to 2.3x over their non-reversible counterparts.

| **[Augmenting Ego-Vehicle for Traffic Near-Miss and Accident Classification Dataset using Manipulating Conditional Style Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02726v1)** | 2023-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To develop the advanced self-driving systems, many researchers are focusing to alert all possible traffic risk cases from closed-circuit television (CCTV) and dashboard-mounted cameras. Most of these methods focused on identifying frame-by-frame in which an anomaly has occurred, but they are unrealized, which road traffic participant can cause ego-vehicle leading into collision because of available annotation dataset only to detect anomaly on traffic video. Near-miss is one type of accident and can be defined as a narrowly avoided accident. However, there is no difference between accident and near-miss at the time before the accident happened, so our contribution is to redefine the accident definition and re-annotate the accident inconsistency on DADA-2000 dataset together with near-miss. By extending the start and end time of accident duration, our annotation can precisely cover all ego-motions during an incident and consistently classify all possible traffic risk accidents including near-miss to give more critical information for real-world driving assistance systems. The proposed method integrates two different components: conditional style translation (CST) and separable 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (S3D). CST architecture is derived by unsupervised image-to-image translation networks (UNIT) used for augmenting the re-annotation DADA-2000 dataset to increase the number of traffic risk accident videos and to generalize the performance of video classification model on different types of conditions while S3D is useful for video classification to prove dataset re-annotation consistency. In evaluation, the proposed method achieved a significant improvement result by 10.25% positive margin from the baseline model for accuracy on cross-validation analysis.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference | None |
| **[Long Movie Clip Classification with State-Space Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01692v3)** | 2023-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most modern video recognition models are designed to operate on short video clips (e.g., 5-10s in length). Thus, it is challenging to apply such models to long movie understanding tasks, which typically require sophisticated long-range temporal reasoning. The recently introduced video transformers partially address this issue by using long-range temporal self-attention. However, due to the quadratic cost of self-attention, such models are often costly and impractical to use. Instead, we propose ViS4mer, an efficient long-range video model that combines the strengths of self-attention and the recently introduced structured state-space sequence (S4) layer. Our model uses a standard Transformer encoder for short-range spatiotemporal feature extraction, and a multi-scale temporal S4 decoder for subsequent long-range temporal reasoning. By progressively reducing the spatiotemporal feature resolution and channel dimension at each decoder layer, ViS4mer learns complex long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in a video. Furthermore, ViS4mer is $2.63\times$ faster and requires $8\times$ less GPU memory than the corresponding pure self-attention-based model. Additionally, ViS4mer achieves state-of-the-art results in $6$ out of $9$ long-form movie video classification tasks on the Long Video Understanding (LVU) benchmark. Furthermore, we show that our approach successfully generalizes to other domains, achieving competitive results on the Breakfast and the COIN procedural activity datasets.

A straightforward migration from images to videos without considering the properties of videos, such as computational cost and redundant information, is not a sound choice. In this paper, we propose two new strategies for video analysis with noisy labels: 1) A lightweight channel selection method dubbed as Channel Truncation for feature-based label noise detection. This method selects the most discriminative channels to split clean and noisy instances in each category; 2) A novel contrastive strategy dubbed as Noise Contrastive Learning, which constructs the relationship between clean and noisy instances to regularize model training. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets for video classification show that our proposed tru{\bf N}cat{\bf E}-split-contr{\bf A}s{\bf T} (NEAT) significantly outperforms the existing baselines. By reducing the dimension to 10\% of it, our method achieves over 0.4 noise detection F1-score and 5\% classification accuracy improvement on Mini-Kinetics dataset under severe noise (symmetric-80\%). Thanks to Noise Contrastive Learning, the average classification accuracy improvement on Mini-Kinetics and Sth-Sth-V1 is over 1.6\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study for adversarial attacks on deep learning-based video compression and downstream classification systems. Our attack framework, dubbed RoVISQ, manipulates the Rate-Distortion ($\textit{R}$-$\textit{D}$) relationship of a video compression model to achieve one or both of the following goals: (1) increasing the network bandwidth, (2) degrading the video quality for end-users. We further devise new objectives for targeted and untargeted attacks to a downstream video classification service. Finally, we design an input-invariant perturbation that universally disrupts video compression and classification systems in real time. Unlike previously proposed attacks on video classification, our adversarial perturbations are the first to withstand compression. We empirically show the resilience of RoVISQ attacks against various defenses, i.e., adversarial training, video denoising, and JPEG compression. Our extensive experimental results on various video datasets show RoVISQ attacks deteriorate peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.6dB and the bit-rate by up to $\sim$ 2.4$\times$ while achieving over 90$\%$ attack success rate on a downstream classifier. Our user study further demonstrates the effect of RoVISQ attacks on users' QoE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Aligning Correlation Information for Domain Adaptation in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04932v2)** | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation (DA) approaches address domain shift and enable networks to be applied to different scenarios. Although various image DA approaches have been proposed in recent years, there is limited research towards video DA. This is partly due to the complexity in adapting the different modalities of features in videos, which includes the correlation features extracted as long-term dependencies of pixels across spatiotemporal dimensions. The correlation features are highly associated with action classes and proven their effectiveness in accurate video feature extraction through the supervised action recognition task. Yet correlation features of the same action would differ across domains due to domain shift. Therefore we propose a novel Adversarial Correlation Adaptation Network (ACAN) to align action videos by aligning pixel correlations. ACAN aims to minimize the distribution of correlation information, termed as Pixel Correlation Discrepancy (PCD). Additionally, video DA research is also limited by the lack of cross-domain video datasets with larger domain shifts. We, therefore, introduce a novel HMDB-ARID dataset with a larger domain shift caused by a larger statistical difference between domains. This dataset is built in an effort to leverage current datasets for dark video classification. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed ACAN for both existing and the new video DA datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset HMDB-ARID is available at https://xuyu0010.github.io/vuda.html.Camera-ready version of this paper accepted at IEEE TNNLS.

| **[AdaPool: Exponential Adaptive Pooling for Information-Retaining Downsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00772v3)** | 2022-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pooling layers are essential building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to reduce computational overhead and increase the receptive fields of proceeding convolutional operations. Their goal is to produce downsampled volumes that closely resemble the input volume while, ideally, also being computationally and memory efficient. Meeting both these requirements remains a challenge. To this end, we propose an adaptive and exponentially weighted pooling method: adaPool. Our method learns a regional-specific fusion of two sets of pooling kernels that are based on the exponent of the Dice-Sorensen coefficient and the exponential maximum, respectively. AdaPool improves the preservation of detail on a range of tasks including image and video classification and object detection. A key property of adaPool is its bidirectional nature. In contrast to common pooling methods, the learned weights can also be used to upsample activation maps. We term this method adaUnPool. We evaluate adaUnPool on image and video super-resolution and frame interpolation. For benchmarking, we introduce Inter4K, a novel high-quality, high frame-rate video dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that adaPool systematically achieves better results across tasks and backbones, while introducing a minor additional computational and memory overhead.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attention Bottlenecks for Multimodal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00135v3)** | 2022-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world by concurrently processing and fusing high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities such as vision and audio. Machine perception models, in stark contrast, are typically modality-specific and optimised for unimodal benchmarks, and hence late-stage fusion of final representations or predictions from each modality (`late-fusion') is still a dominant paradigm for multimodal video classification. Instead, we introduce a novel transformer based architecture that uses `fusion bottlenecks' for modality fusion at multiple layers. Compared to traditional pairwise self-attention, our model forces information between different modalities to pass through a small number of bottleneck latents, requiring the model to collate and condense the most relevant information in each modality and only share what is necessary. We find that such a strategy improves fusion performance, at the same time reducing computational cost. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple audio-visual classification benchmarks including Audioset, Epic-Kitchens and VGGSound. All code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2021.

| **[Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Leads to Higher Adversarial Susceptibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10862v2)** | 2022-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) has managed to match or surpass the performance of supervised learning in image and video classification. However, it is still largely unknown if the nature of the representations induced by the two learning paradigms is similar. We investigate this under the lens of adversarial robustness. Our analysis of the problem reveals that CSL has intrinsically higher sensitivity to perturbations over supervised learning. We identify the uniform distribution of data representation over a unit hypersphere in the CSL representation space as the key contributor to this phenomenon. We establish that this is a result of the presence of false negative pairs in the training process, which increases model sensitivity to input perturbations. Our finding is supported by extensive experiments for image and video classification using adversarial perturbations and other input corruptions. We devise a strategy to detect and remove false negative pairs that is simple, yet effective in improving model robustness with CSL training. We close up to 68% of the robustness gap between CSL and its supervised counterpart. Finally, we contribute to adversarial learning by incorporating our method in CSL. We demonstrate an average gain of about 5% over two different state-of-the-art methods in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, to appear at AAAI-2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Unsupervised Key Frame Extraction for Efficient Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06742v1)** | 2022-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video processing and analysis have become an urgent task since a huge amount of videos (e.g., Youtube, Hulu) are uploaded online every day. The extraction of representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing and analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although great progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains an open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance and efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an unsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The proposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages compared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key frames automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal information of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video classification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added on the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification. Moreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to boost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame extraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and higher efficiency. We evaluate our method on two popular datasets (i.e., HMDB51 and UCF101) and the experimental results consistently demonstrate that our strategy achieves competitive performance and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted to TOMM | None |

Many methods have been proposed for producing heat-map--based explanations for this purpose, including ones based on the white-box approach that uses the internal information of a model (e.g., LRP, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++) and ones based on the black-box approach that does not use any internal information (e.g., LIME, SHAP, and RISE). We propose a new black-box method BOREx (Bayesian Optimization for Refinement of visual model Explanation) to refine a heat map produced by any method. Our observation is that a heat-map--based explanation can be seen as a prior for an explanation method based on Bayesian optimization. Based on this observation, BOREx conducts Gaussian process regression (GPR) to estimate the saliency of each pixel in a given image starting from the one produced by another explanation method. Our experiments statistically demonstrate that the refinement by BOREx improves low-quality heat maps for image- and video-classification results.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages.

| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Transformers in Low-Labeled Video Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07474v3)** | 2022-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently vision transformers have been shown to be competitive with convolution-based methods (CNNs) broadly across multiple vision tasks. The less restrictive inductive bias of transformers endows greater representational capacity in comparison with CNNs. However, in the image classification setting this flexibility comes with a trade-off with respect to sample efficiency, where transformers require ImageNet-scale training. This notion has carried over to video where transformers have not yet been explored for video classification in the low-labeled or semi-supervised settings. Our work empirically explores the low data regime for video classification and discovers that, surprisingly, transformers perform extremely well in the low-labeled video setting compared to CNNs. We specifically evaluate video vision transformers across two contrasting video datasets (Kinetics-400 and SomethingSomething-V2) and perform thorough analysis and ablation studies to explain this observation using the predominant features of video transformer architectures. We even show that using just the labeled data, transformers significantly outperform complex semi-supervised CNN methods that leverage large-scale unlabeled data as well. Our experiments inform our recommendation that semi-supervised learning video work should consider the use of video transformers in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Vision Transformers: Theory and applications (VTTA)</p></details> | None |

MASTAF takes input from a general video spatial and temporal representation,e.g., using 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and Video Transformer. Then, to make the most of such representations, we use self- and cross-attention models to highlight the critical spatio-temporal region to increase the inter-class variations and decrease the intra-class variations. Last, MASTAF applies a lightweight fusion network and a nearest neighbor classifier to classify each query video. We demonstrate that MASTAF improves the state-of-the-art performance on three few-shot video classification benchmarks(UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2), e.g., by up to 91.6%, 69.5%, and 60.7% for five-way one-shot video classification, respectively.</p></details> | WACV 2023 | None |
| **[Linear Video Transformer with Feature Fixation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08164v1)** | 2022-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have achieved impressive performance in video classification, while suffering from the quadratic complexity caused by the Softmax attention mechanism. Some studies alleviate the computational costs by reducing the number of tokens in attention calculation, but the complexity is still quadratic. Another promising way is to replace Softmax attention with linear attention, which owns linear complexity but presents a clear performance drop. We find that such a drop in linear attention results from the lack of attention concentration on critical features. Therefore, we propose a feature fixation module to reweight the feature importance of the query and key before computing linear attention. Specifically, we regard the query, key, and value as various latent representations of the input token, and learn the feature fixation ratio by aggregating Query-Key-Value information. This is beneficial for measuring the feature importance comprehensively. Furthermore, we enhance the feature fixation by neighborhood association, which leverages additional guidance from spatial and temporal neighbouring tokens. The proposed method significantly improves the linear attention baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance among linear video Transformers on three popular video classification benchmarks. With fewer parameters and higher efficiency, our performance is even comparable to some Softmax-based quadratic Transformers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[S4ND: Modeling Images and Videos as Multidimensional Signals Using State Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06583v2)** | 2022-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data such as images and videos are typically modeled as discretizations of inherently continuous, multidimensional signals. Existing continuous-signal models attempt to exploit this fact by modeling the underlying signals of visual (e.g., image) data directly. However, these models have not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision tasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent line of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new multidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability of SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND can model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous multidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping Conv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art models. On ImageNet-1k, S4ND exceeds the performance of a Vision Transformer baseline by $1.5\%$ when training with a $1$D sequence of patches, and matches ConvNeXt when modeling images in $2$D. For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated $3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\%$. S4ND implicitly learns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant by construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across multiple resolutions. By developing a simple bandlimiting modification to S4 to overcome aliasing, S4ND achieves strong zero-shot (unseen at training time) resolution performance, outperforming a baseline Conv2D by $40\%$ on CIFAR-10 when trained on $8 \times 8$ and tested on $32 \times 32$ images. When trained with progressive resizing, S4ND comes within $\sim 1\%$ of a high-resolution model while training $22\%$ faster.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 | None |

Existing approaches focus on modifying the architecture of 2D networks (e.g. by including filters in the temporal dimension to turn them into 3D networks, or using optical flow, etc.), which increases computation cost. Instead, we propose a novel sampling strategy, where we re-order the channels of the input video, to capture short-term frame-to-frame changes. We observe that without bells and whistles, the proposed sampling strategy improves performance on multiple architectures (e.g. TSN, TRN, TSM, and MVFNet) and datasets (CATER, Something-Something-V1 and V2), up to 24% over the baseline of using the standard video input. In addition, our sampling strategies do not require training from scratch and do not increase the computational cost of training and testing. Given the generality of the results and the flexibility of the approach, we hope this can be widely useful to the video understanding community.

Most previous studies on efficient analysis and prediction of traffic accidents, however, have used small-scale datasets with limited coverage, which limits their effect and applicability. Existing datasets in traffic accidents are either small-scale, not from surveillance cameras, not open-sourced, or not built for freeway scenes. Since accidents happened in freeways tend to cause serious damage and are too fast to catch the spot. An open-sourced datasets targeting on freeway traffic accidents collected from surveillance cameras is in great need and of practical importance. In order to help the vision community address these shortcomings, we endeavor to collect video data of real traffic accidents that covered abundant scenes. After integration and annotation by various dimensions, a large-scale traffic accidents dataset named TAD is proposed in this work. Various experiments on image classification, object detection, and video classification tasks, using public mainstream vision algorithms or frameworks are conducted in this work to demonstrate performance of different methods. The proposed dataset together with the experimental results are presented as a new benchmark to improve computer vision research, especially in ITS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FuTH-Net: Fusing Temporal Relations and Holistic Features for Aerial Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11316v1)** | 2022-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now widely applied to data acquisition due to its low cost and fast mobility. With the increasing volume of aerial videos, the demand for automatically parsing these videos is surging. To achieve this, current researches mainly focus on extracting a holistic feature with convolutions along both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these methods are limited by small temporal receptive fields and cannot adequately capture long-term temporal dependencies which are important for describing complicated dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network, termed FuTH-Net, to model not only holistic features, but also temporal relations for aerial video classification. Furthermore, the holistic features are refined by the multi-scale temporal relations in a novel fusion module for yielding more discriminative video representations. More specially, FuTH-Net employs a two-pathway architecture: (1) a holistic representation pathway to learn a general feature of both frame appearances and shortterm temporal variations and (2) a temporal relation pathway to capture multi-scale temporal relations across arbitrary frames, providing long-term temporal dependencies. Afterwards, a novel fusion module is proposed to spatiotemporal integrate the two features learned from the two pathways. Our model is evaluated on two aerial video classification datasets, ERA and Drone-Action, and achieves the state-of-the-art results. This demonstrates its effectiveness and good generalization capacity across different recognition tasks (event classification and human action recognition). To facilitate further research, we release the code at https://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/reasoning/futh-net.</p></details> |  | None |

Patch attacks can be highly effective in a variety of tasks and physically realizable via attachment (e.g. a sticker) to the real-world objects. Despite the diversity in attack patterns, adversarial patches tend to be highly textured and different in appearance from natural images. We exploit this property and present PatchZero, a general defense pipeline against white-box adversarial patches without retraining the downstream classifier or detector. Specifically, our defense detects adversaries at the pixel-level and "zeros out" the patch region by repainting with mean pixel values. We further design a two-stage adversarial training scheme to defend against the stronger adaptive attacks. PatchZero achieves SOTA defense performance on the image classification (ImageNet, RESISC45), object detection (PASCAL VOC), and video classification (UCF101) tasks with little degradation in benign performance.

However, video datasets that capture violent and non-violent human activity from aerial point-of-view is scarce. To address this issue, we propose a novel, baseline simulator which is capable of generating sequences of photo-realistic synthetic images of crowds engaging in various activities that can be categorized as violent or non-violent. The crowd groups are annotated with bounding boxes that are automatically computed using semantic segmentation. Our simulator is capable of generating large, randomized urban environments and is able to maintain an average of 25 frames per second on a mid-range computer with 150 concurrent crowd agents interacting with each other. We also show that when synthetic data from the proposed simulator is augmented with real world data, binary video classification accuracy is improved by 5% on average across two different models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches fail to sufficiently exploit short-term motion dynamics, which are crucial to various down-stream video understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose Motion Sensitive Contrastive Learning (MSCL) that injects the motion information captured by optical flows into RGB frames to strengthen feature learning. To achieve this, in addition to clip-level global contrastive learning, we develop Local Motion Contrastive Learning (LMCL) with frame-level contrastive objectives across the two modalities. Moreover, we introduce Flow Rotation Augmentation (FRA) to generate extra motion-shuffled negative samples and Motion Differential Sampling (MDS) to accurately screen training samples. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the commonly-used 3D ResNet-18 as the backbone, we achieve the top-1 accuracies of 91.5\% on UCF101 and 50.3\% on Something-Something v2 for video classification, and a 65.6\% Top-1 Recall on UCF101 for video retrieval, notably improving the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2022, 17 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[Two-Stream Transformer Architecture for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01753v1)** | 2022-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pure vision transformer architectures are highly effective for short video classification and action recognition tasks. However, due to the quadratic complexity of self attention and lack of inductive bias, transformers are resource intensive and suffer from data inefficiencies. Long form video understanding tasks amplify data and memory efficiency problems in transformers making current approaches unfeasible to implement on data or memory restricted domains. This paper introduces an efficient Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) which uses a two-stream transformer architecture to model dependencies between static image features and temporal contextual features. Our proposed approach can classify videos up to two minutes in length on a single GPU, is data efficient, and achieves SOTA performance on several long video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Token Sampling For Efficient Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15667v3)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While state-of-the-art vision transformer models achieve promising results in image classification, they are computationally expensive and require many GFLOPs. Although the GFLOPs of a vision transformer can be decreased by reducing the number of tokens in the network, there is no setting that is optimal for all input images. In this work, we therefore introduce a differentiable parameter-free Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS) module, which can be plugged into any existing vision transformer architecture. ATS empowers vision transformers by scoring and adaptively sampling significant tokens. As a result, the number of tokens is not constant anymore and varies for each input image. By integrating ATS as an additional layer within the current transformer blocks, we can convert them into much more efficient vision transformers with an adaptive number of tokens. Since ATS is a parameter-free module, it can be added to the off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers as a plug and play module, thus reducing their GFLOPs without any additional training. Moreover, due to its differentiable design, one can also train a vision transformer equipped with ATS. We evaluate the efficiency of our module in both image and video classification tasks by adding it to multiple SOTA vision transformers. Our proposed module improves the SOTA by reducing their computational costs (GFLOPs) by 2X, while preserving their accuracy on the ImageNet, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets.</p></details> | ECCV 2022 | None |

These videos investigate the spatiotemporal knowledge of human behavior. The promising ability is investigated using 3D convolution neural networks (CNNs). The 3D CNNs have not yet achieved high output for their well-established two-dimensional (2D) equivalents in still photographs. Board 3D Convolutional Memory and Spatiotemporal fusion face training difficulty preventing 3D CNN from accomplishing remarkable evaluation. In this paper, we implement Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture that combines STIP and 3D CNN features to enhance the performance of 3D videos effectively. After implementation, the more detailed and deeper charting for training in each circle of space-time fusion. The training model further enhances the results after handling complicated evaluations of models. The video classification model is used in this implemented model.

In the implementation of the result, the well-known dataset, i.e., UCF101 to, evaluates the performance of the proposed hybrid technique. The results beat the proposed hybrid technique that substantially beats the initial 3D CNNs.

| **[Long-term Leap Attention, Short-term Periodic Shift for Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05526v2)** | 2022-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video transformer naturally incurs a heavier computation burden than a static vision transformer, as the former processes $T$ times longer sequence than the latter under the current attention of quadratic complexity $(T^2N^2)$. The existing works treat the temporal axis as a simple extension of spatial axes, focusing on shortening the spatio-temporal sequence by either generic pooling or local windowing without utilizing temporal redundancy. However, videos naturally contain redundant information between neighboring frames; thereby, we could potentially suppress attention on visually similar frames in a dilated manner. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the LAPS, a long-term ``\textbf{\textit{Leap Attention}}'' (LA), short-term ``\textbf{\textit{Periodic Shift}}'' (\textit{P}-Shift) module for video transformers, with $(2TN^2)$ complexity. Specifically, the ``LA'' groups long-term frames into pairs, then refactors each discrete pair via attention. The ``\textit{P}-Shift'' exchanges features between temporal neighbors to confront the loss of short-term dynamics. By replacing a vanilla 2D attention with the LAPS, we could adapt a static transformer into a video one, with zero extra parameters and neglectable computation overhead ($\sim$2.6\%). Experiments on the standard Kinetics-400 benchmark demonstrate that our LAPS transformer could achieve competitive performances in terms of accuracy, FLOPs, and Params among CNN and transformer SOTAs.

In particular, given a pair of query and support videos, we conduct appearance alignment via frame-level feature matching to achieve the appearance similarity score between the videos, while utilizing temporal order-preserving priors for obtaining the temporal similarity score between the videos. Moreover, we introduce a few-shot video classification framework that leverages the above appearance and temporal similarity scores across multiple steps, namely prototype-based training and testing as well as inductive and transductive prototype refinement. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore transductive few-shot video classification. Extensive experiments on both Kinetics and Something-Something V2 datasets show that both appearance and temporal alignments are crucial for datasets with temporal order sensitivity such as Something-Something V2. Our approach achieves similar or better results than previous methods on both datasets.

While our community has made great strides in fine-grained visual categorization on images, the counterparts in audio and video fine-grained categorization are relatively unexplored. To encourage advancements in this space, we have carefully constructed the SSW60 dataset to enable researchers to experiment with classifying the same set of categories in three different modalities: images, audio, and video. The dataset covers 60 species of birds and is comprised of images from existing datasets, and brand new, expert-curated audio and video datasets. We thoroughly benchmark audiovisual classification performance and modality fusion experiments through the use of state-of-the-art transformer methods. Our findings show that performance of audiovisual fusion methods is better than using exclusively image or audio based methods for the task of video classification. We also present interesting modality transfer experiments, enabled by the unique construction of SSW60 to encompass three different modalities. We hope the SSW60 dataset and accompanying baselines spur research in this fascinating area.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

Adaptive inference based efficient video recognition methods typically preview videos and focus on salient parts to reduce computation costs. Most existing works focus on complex networks learning with video classification based objectives. Taking all frames as positive samples, few of them pay attention to the discrimination between positive samples (salient frames) and negative samples (non-salient frames) in supervisions. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Non-saliency Suppression Network (NSNet), which effectively suppresses the responses of non-salient frames. Specifically, on the frame level, effective pseudo labels that can distinguish between salient and non-salient frames are generated to guide the frame saliency learning. On the video level, a temporal attention module is learned under dual video-level supervisions on both the salient and the non-salient representations. Saliency measurements from both two levels are combined for exploitation of multi-granularity complementary information. Extensive experiments conducted on four well-known benchmarks verify our NSNet not only achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off but also present a significantly faster (2.4~4.3x) practical inference speed than state-of-the-art methods.

Most of the existing self-supervised representation learning methods typically cluster samples based on visually dominant features. While this works well for image-based self-supervision, it often fails for videos, which require understanding motion rather than focusing on background. Using optical flow as complementary information to RGB can alleviate this problem. However, we observe that a naive combination of the two views does not provide meaningful gains. In this paper, we propose a principled way to combine two views. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering strategy where we use the initial cluster assignment of each view as prior to guide the final cluster assignment of the other view. This idea will enforce similar cluster structures for both views, and the formed clusters will be semantically abstract and robust to noisy inputs coming from each individual view. Additionally, we propose a novel regularization strategy to address the feature collapse problem, which is common in cluster-based self-supervised learning methods. Our extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of our learned representations on downstream tasks, e.g., video retrieval and action recognition. Specifically, we outperform the state of the art by 7% on UCF and 4% on HMDB for video retrieval, and 5% on UCF and 6% on HMDB for video classification</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2022</p></details> | None |

The natural semantic and temporal alignment between audio and visual data in video data can be exploited to learn powerful representations that generalise to unseen classes at test time. We propose a multi-modal and Temporal Cross-attention Framework (\modelName) for audio-visual generalised zero-shot learning. Its inputs are temporally aligned audio and visual features that are obtained from pre-trained networks. Encouraging the framework to focus on cross-modal correspondence across time instead of self-attention within the modalities boosts the performance significantly. We show that our proposed framework that ingests temporal features yields state-of-the-art performance on the \ucf, \vgg, and \activity benchmarks for (generalised) zero-shot learning.

In this work, we extend this paradigm by leveraging motion and audio that naturally exist in video. We present \textbf{MOV}, a simple yet effective method for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary video classification. In MOV, we directly use the vision encoder from pre-trained VLMs with minimal modifications to encode video, optical flow and audio spectrogram. We design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to aggregate complimentary multimodal information. Experiments on Kinetics-700 and VGGSound show that introducing flow or audio modality brings large performance gains over the pre-trained VLM and existing methods. Specifically, MOV greatly improves the accuracy on base classes, while generalizes better on novel classes. MOV achieves state-of-the-art results on UCF and HMDB zero-shot video classification benchmarks, significantly outperforming both traditional zero-shot methods and recent methods based on VLMs. Code and models will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Calibrating Class Weights with Multi-Modal Information for Partial Video Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06187v3)** | 2022-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assuming the source label space subsumes the target one, Partial Video Domain Adaptation (PVDA) is a more general and practical scenario for cross-domain video classification problems. The key challenge of PVDA is to mitigate the negative transfer caused by the source-only outlier classes. To tackle this challenge, a crucial step is to aggregate target predictions to assign class weights by up-weighing target classes and down-weighing outlier classes. However, the incorrect predictions of class weights can mislead the network and lead to negative transfer. Previous works improve the class weight accuracy by utilizing temporal features and attention mechanisms, but these methods may fall short when trying to generate accurate class weight when domain shifts are significant, as in most real-world scenarios. To deal with these challenges, we propose the Multi-modality Cluster-calibrated partial Adversarial Network (MCAN). MCAN enhances video feature extraction with multi-modal features from multiple temporal scales to form more robust overall features. It utilizes a novel class weight calibration method to alleviate the negative transfer caused by incorrect class weights. The calibration method tries to identify and weigh correct and incorrect predictions using distributional information implied by unsupervised clustering. Extensive experiments are conducted on prevailing PVDA benchmarks, and the proposed MCAN achieves significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art PVDA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia (ACMMM) 2022, update to camera-ready version. 8 pages of text, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Models are typically pretrained on large ``upstream'' datasets for classification, as such labels are easy to collect, and then finetuned on ``downstream'' tasks such as action localisation, which are smaller due to their finer-grained annotations. In this paper, we question this approach, and propose co-finetuning -- simultaneously training a single model on multiple ``upstream'' and ``downstream'' tasks. We demonstrate that co-finetuning outperforms traditional transfer learning when using the same total amount of data, and also show how we can easily extend our approach to multiple ``upstream'' datasets to further improve performance. In particular, co-finetuning significantly improves the performance on rare classes in our downstream task, as it has a regularising effect, and enables the network to learn feature representations that transfer between different datasets. Finally, we observe how co-finetuning with public, video classification datasets, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results for spatio-temporal action localisation on the challenging AVA and AVA-Kinetics datasets, outperforming recent works which develop intricate models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, video data in the real world typically exhibit an imbalanced long-tailed class distribution, resulting in a model bias towards head class and relatively low performance on tail class. While the current long-tailed classification methods usually focus on image classification, adapting it to video data is not a trivial extension. We propose an end-to-end multi-expert distribution calibration method to address these challenges based on two-level distribution information. The method jointly considers the distribution of samples in each class (intra-class distribution) and the overall distribution of diverse data (inter-class distribution) to solve the issue of imbalanced data under long-tailed distribution. By modeling the two-level distribution information, the model can jointly consider the head classes and the tail classes and significantly transfer the knowledge from the head classes to improve the performance of the tail classes. Extensive experiments verify that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the long-tailed video classification task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the accuracy relies heavily on radiologist experience. Although deep learning techniques have been investigated for thyroid nodules recognition. Current solutions are mainly based on static ultrasound images, with limited temporal information used and inconsistent with clinical diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel method for the automated recognition of thyroid nodules through an exhaustive exploration of ultrasound videos and key-frames. We first propose a detection-localization framework to automatically identify the clinical key-frame with a typical nodule in each ultrasound video. Based on the localized key-frame, we develop a key-frame guided video classification model for thyroid nodule recognition. Besides, we introduce a motion attention module to help the network focus on significant frames in an ultrasound video, which is consistent with clinical diagnosis. The proposed thyroid nodule recognition framework is validated on clinically collected ultrasound videos, demonstrating superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these concept bottleneck models rely on a necessary and sufficient set of predefined concepts-which is intractable for complex tasks such as video classification. For complex tasks, the labels and the relationship between visual elements span many frames, e.g., identifying a bird flying or catching prey-necessitating concepts with various levels of abstraction. To this end, we present CoDEx, an automatic Concept Discovery and Extraction module that rigorously composes a necessary and sufficient set of concept abstractions for concept-based video classification. CoDEx identifies a rich set of complex concept abstractions from natural language explanations of videos-obviating the need to predefine the amorphous set of concepts. To demonstrate our method's viability, we construct two new public datasets that combine existing complex video classification datasets with short, crowd-sourced natural language explanations for their labels. Our method elicits inherent complex concept abstractions in natural language to generalize concept-bottleneck methods to complex tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Appendix: 2 pages</p></details> | None |

Accurately categorizing these activities requires not only recognizing the individual steps that compose the task but also capturing their temporal dependencies. This problem is dramatically different from traditional action classification, where models are typically optimized on videos that span only a few seconds and that are manually trimmed to contain simple atomic actions. While step annotations could enable the training of models to recognize the individual steps of procedural activities, existing large-scale datasets in this area do not include such segment labels due to the prohibitive cost of manually annotating temporal boundaries in long videos. To address this issue, we propose to automatically identify steps in instructional videos by leveraging the distant supervision of a textual knowledge base (wikiHow) that includes detailed descriptions of the steps needed for the execution of a wide variety of complex activities. Our method uses a language model to match noisy, automatically-transcribed speech from the video to step descriptions in the knowledge base. We demonstrate that video models trained to recognize these automatically-labeled steps (without manual supervision) yield a representation that achieves superior generalization performance on four downstream tasks: recognition of procedural activities, step classification, step forecasting and egocentric video classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2022.

However, the effectiveness of AT as a defense for video classification has not been thoroughly studied. Our first contribution is to show that generating optimal attacks for video requires carefully tuning the attack parameters, especially the step size. Notably, we show that the optimal step size varies linearly with the attack budget. Our second contribution is to show that using a smaller (sub-optimal) attack budget at training time leads to a more robust performance at test time. Based on these findings, we propose three defenses against attacks with variable attack budgets. The first one, Adaptive AT, is a technique where the attack budget is drawn from a distribution that is adapted as training iterations proceed. The second, Curriculum AT, is a technique where the attack budget is increased as training iterations proceed. The third, Generative AT, further couples AT with a denoising generative adversarial network to boost robust performance. Experiments on the UCF101 dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods improve adversarial robustness against multiple attack types.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOS! Self-supervised Learning Over Sets Of Handled Objects In Egocentric Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04796v2)** | 2022-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning an egocentric action recognition model from video data is challenging due to distractors (e.g., irrelevant objects) in the background. Further integrating object information into an action model is hence beneficial. Existing methods often leverage a generic object detector to identify and represent the objects in the scene. However, several important issues remain. Object class annotations of good quality for the target domain (dataset) are still required for learning good object representation. Besides, previous methods deeply couple the existing action models and need to retrain them jointly with object representation, leading to costly and inflexible integration. To overcome both limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning Over Sets (SOS), an approach to pre-train a generic Objects In Contact (OIC) representation model from video object regions detected by an off-the-shelf hand-object contact detector. Instead of augmenting object regions individually as in conventional self-supervised learning, we view the action process as a means of natural data transformations with unique spatio-temporal continuity and exploit the inherent relationships among per-video object sets. Extensive experiments on two datasets, EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA, show that our OIC significantly boosts the performance of multiple state-of-the-art video classification models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attention in Attention: Modeling Context Correlation for Efficient Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09303v1)** | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have significantly boosted the performance of video classification neural networks thanks to the utilization of perspective contexts. However, the current research on video attention generally focuses on adopting a specific aspect of contexts (e.g., channel, spatial/temporal, or global context) to refine the features and neglects their underlying correlation when computing attentions. This leads to incomplete context utilization and hence bears the weakness of limited performance improvement. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-in-attention (AIA) method for element-wise feature refinement, which investigates the feasibility of inserting the channel context into the spatio-temporal attention learning module, referred to as CinST, and also its reverse variant, referred to as STinC. Specifically, we instantiate the video feature contexts as dynamics aggregated along a specific axis with global average and max pooling operations. The workflow of an AIA module is that the first attention block uses one kind of context information to guide the gating weights calculation of the second attention that targets at the other context. Moreover, all the computational operations in attention units act on the pooled dimension, which results in quite few computational cost increase ($<$0.02\%). To verify our method, we densely integrate it into two classical video network backbones and conduct extensive experiments on several standard video classification benchmarks. The source code of our AIA is available at \url{https://github.com/haoyanbin918/Attention-in-Attention}.</p></details> | 13 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/haoyanbin918/Attention-in-Attention) |

Specifically, we formulate a supervised contrastive loss to simultaneously align visual-semantic features (i.e., alignment) and encourage the learned features to distribute uniformly (i.e., uniformity). Unlike existing methods that only consider the alignment, we propose uniformity to preserve maximal-info of existing features, which improves the probability that unobserved features fall around observed data. Further, we synthesize features of unseen classes by proposing a class generator that interpolates and extrapolates the features of seen classes. Besides, we introduce two metrics, closeness and dispersion, to quantify the two properties and serve as new measurements of model generalizability. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms SoTA by relative improvements of 28.1% on UCF101 and 27.0% on HMDB51. Code is available.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 | None |
| **[Unsupervised Pre-training for Temporal Action Localization Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13609v1)** | 2022-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised video representation learning has made remarkable achievements in recent years. However, most existing methods are designed and optimized for video classification. These pre-trained models can be sub-optimal for temporal localization tasks due to the inherent discrepancy between video-level classification and clip-level localization. To bridge this gap, we make the first attempt to propose a self-supervised pretext task, coined as Pseudo Action Localization (PAL) to Unsupervisedly Pre-train feature encoders for Temporal Action Localization tasks (UP-TAL). Specifically, we first randomly select temporal regions, each of which contains multiple clips, from one video as pseudo actions and then paste them onto different temporal positions of the other two videos. The pretext task is to align the features of pasted pseudo action regions from two synthetic videos and maximize the agreement between them. Compared to the existing unsupervised video representation learning approaches, our PAL adapts better to downstream TAL tasks by introducing a temporal equivariant contrastive learning paradigm in a temporally dense and scale-aware manner. Extensive experiments show that PAL can utilize large-scale unlabeled video data to significantly boost the performance of existing TAL methods. Our codes and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zhang-can/UP-TAL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2022</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhang-can/UP-TAL) |

In this work, we present two semi-supervised approaches that automate this process of manual frame sifting in video streams by automatically classifying scenes for content and filtering frames for fine-tuning scene understanding tasks. The first rule-based method starts from a pre-trained object detector and it assigns scene type, uncertainty and lighting categories to each frame based on probability distributions of foreground objects. Next, frames with the highest uncertainty and structural dissimilarity are isolated as key-frames. The second method relies on the simCLR model for frame encoding followed by label-spreading from 20% of frame samples to label the remaining frames for scene and lighting categories. Also, clustering the video frames in the encoded feature space further isolates key-frames at cluster boundaries. The proposed methods achieve 64-93% accuracy for automated scene categorization for outdoor image videos from public domain datasets of JAAD and KITTI. Also, less than 10% of all input frames can be filtered as key-frames that can then be sent for annotation and fine tuning of machine vision algorithms. Thus, the proposed framework can be scaled to additional video data streams for automated training of perception-driven systems with minimal training images.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 images, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

In computer vision research community, temporal reasoning is usually studied in the form of video classification, for which many state-of-the-art Neural Network structures and dataset benchmarks are proposed in recent years, especially 3D CNNs and Kinetics. However, some recent works found that current video classification benchmarks contain strong biases towards static features, thus cannot accurately reflect the temporal modeling ability. New video classification benchmarks aiming to eliminate static biases are proposed, with experiments on these new benchmarks showing that the current clip-based 3D CNNs are outperformed by RNN structures and recent video transformers. In this paper, we find that 3D CNNs and their efficient depthwise variants, when video-level sampling strategy is used, are actually able to beat RNNs and recent vision transformers by significant margins on static-unbiased temporal reasoning benchmarks. Further, we propose Temporal Fully Connected Block (TFC Block), an efficient and effective component, which approximates fully connected layers along temporal dimension to obtain video-level receptive field, enhancing the spatiotemporal reasoning ability. With TFC blocks inserted into Video-level 3D CNNs (V3D), our proposed TFCNets establish new state-of-the-art results on synthetic temporal reasoning benchmark, CATER, and real world static-unbiased dataset, Diving48, surpassing all previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and model will be released once accepted</p></details> | None |

While ensembles and cascades are well-known techniques that were proposed before deep learning, they are not considered a core building block of deep model architectures and are rarely compared to in recent literature on developing efficient models. In this work, we go back to basics and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of committee-based models. We find that even the most simplistic method for building committees from existing, independently pre-trained models can match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art models while being drastically more efficient. These simple committee-based models also outperform sophisticated neural architecture search methods (e.g., BigNAS). These findings hold true for several tasks, including image classification, video classification, and semantic segmentation, and various architecture families, such as ViT, EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNetV2, and X3D. Our results show that an EfficientNet cascade can achieve a 5.4x speedup over B7 and a ViT cascade can achieve a 2.3x speedup over ViT-L-384 while being equally accurate.</p></details> | ICLR 2022 | None |

It has been extensively studied for many years now and current state-of-the-art 2D object detection techniques proffer superlative results even in complex images. In this chapter, we discuss the geometry-based pioneering works in object detection, followed by the recent breakthroughs that employ deep learning. Some of these use a monolithic architecture that takes a RGB image as input and passes it to a feed-forward ConvNet or vision Transformer. These methods, thereby predict class-probability and bounding-box coordinates, all in a single unified pipeline. Two-stage architectures on the other hand, first generate region proposals and then feed it to a CNN to extract features and predict object category and bounding-box. We also elaborate upon the applications of object detection in video event recognition, to achieve better fine-grained video classification performance.

| **[Busy-Quiet Video Disentangling for Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15584v4)** | 2022-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video data, busy motion details from moving regions are conveyed within a specific frequency bandwidth in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the rest of the frequencies of video data are encoded with quiet information with substantial redundancy, which causes low processing efficiency in existing video models that take as input raw RGB frames. In this paper, we consider allocating intenser computation for the processing of the important busy information and less computation for that of the quiet information. We design a trainable Motion Band-Pass Module (MBPM) for separating busy information from quiet information in raw video data. By embedding the MBPM into a two-pathway CNN architecture, we define a Busy-Quiet Net (BQN). The efficiency of BQN is determined by avoiding redundancy in the feature space processed by the two pathways: one operating on Quiet features of low-resolution, while the other processes Busy features. The proposed BQN outperforms many recent video processing models on Something-Something V1, Kinetics400, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is difficult to learn discriminative feature representations for videos in such a setting. In this paper, we propose Temporal Alignment Prediction (TAP) based on sequence similarity learning for few-shot video classification. In order to obtain the similarity of a pair of videos, we predict the alignment scores between all pairs of temporal positions in the two videos with the temporal alignment prediction function. Besides, the inputs to this function are also equipped with the context information in the temporal domain. We evaluate TAP on two video classification benchmarks including Kinetics and Something-Something V2.

Current approaches mostly focus on effectively exploiting the temporal dimension in videos to improve learning under low data regimes. However, most works have largely ignored that videos are often accompanied by rich textual descriptions that can also be an essential source of information to handle few-shot recognition cases. In this paper, we propose to leverage these human-provided textual descriptions as privileged information when training a few-shot video classification model. Specifically, we formulate a text-based task conditioner to adapt video features to the few-shot learning task. Furthermore, our model follows a transductive setting to improve the task-adaptation ability of the model by using the support textual descriptions and query instances to update a set of class prototypes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four challenging benchmarks commonly used to evaluate few-shot video action classification models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages including references, 6 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Yet, most work has been focused on detecting anomalous frames in surveillance videos taken from security cameras. Meanwhile, the task of anomaly detection (AD) in videos exhibiting anomalous mechanical behavior, has been mostly overlooked. Anomaly detection in such videos is both of academic and practical interest, as they may enable automatic detection of malfunctions in many manufacturing, maintenance, and real-life settings. To assess the potential of the different approaches to detect such anomalies, we evaluate two simple baseline approaches: (i) Temporal-pooled image AD techniques. (ii) Density estimation of videos represented with features pretrained for video-classification. Development of such methods calls for new benchmarks to allow evaluation of different possible approaches. We introduce the Physical Anomalous Trajectory or Motion (PHANTOM) dataset, which contains six different video classes. Each class consists of normal and anomalous videos. The classes differ in the presented phenomena, the normal class variability, and the kind of anomalies in the videos. We also suggest an even harder benchmark where anomalous activities should be spotted on highly variable scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when an explicit structure is not available, it is not obvious what atomic elements should be represented as nodes. Current works generally use pre-trained object detectors or fixed, predefined regions to extract graph nodes. Improving upon this, our proposed model learns nodes that dynamically attach to well-delimited salient regions, which are relevant for a higher-level task, without using any object-level supervision. Constructing these localized, adaptive nodes gives our model inductive bias towards object-centric representations and we show that it discovers regions that are well correlated with objects in the video. In extensive ablation studies and experiments on two challenging datasets, we show superior performance to previous graph neural networks models for video classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021)</p></details> | None |

One of the primary challenges for the practical use of EEG-based monitoring is to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy in EEG classification. Connectivity between different brain regions is an important property for the classification of EEG. However, how to define the connectivity structure for a given task is still an open problem, because there is no ground truth about how the connectivity structure should be in order to maximize the classification performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network model for EEG-based emotional video classification, which can extract an appropriate multi-layer graph structure and signal features directly from a set of raw EEG signals and perform classification using them. Experimental results demonstrate that our method yields improved performance in comparison to the existing approaches where manually defined connectivity structures and signal features are used. Furthermore, we show that the graph structure extraction process is reliable in terms of consistency, and the learned graph structures make much sense in the viewpoint of emotional perception occurring in the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> | None |

However, 3D CNNs usually require as input a square-shaped video, whose spatial dimension is smaller than the original. Random- or center-cropping may leave out the video's subject altogether. To address this, we propose an unsupervised video cropping approach by shaping this as a retargeting and video-to-video synthesis problem. The synthesized video maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio, is smaller in size and is targeted at video-subject(s) throughout the entire duration. First, action localization is performed on each frame by identifying patches with homogeneous motion patterns. Thus, a single salient patch is pinpointed per frame. But to avoid viewpoint jitters and flickering, any inter-frame scale or position changes among the patches should be performed gradually over time. This issue is addressed with a polyBezier fitting in 3D space that passes through some chosen pivot timestamps and whose shape is influenced by the in-between control timestamps. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate the video classification task by comparing our dynamic cropping technique with random cropping on three benchmark datasets, viz. UCF-101, HMDB-51 and ActivityNet v1.3. The clip and top-1 accuracy for video classification after our cropping, outperform 3D CNN performances for same-sized random-crop inputs, also surpassing some larger random-crop sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in Proceedings of 2021 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), 7-10 December 2021, Auckland, New Zealand</p></details> | None |

Despite of dramatic progresses in the area of video classification research, a severe problem faced by the community is that the detailed understanding of human actions is ignored. Our motivation is that parsing human actions needs to build models that focus on the specific problem. We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled action parsing (DAP). Specifically, we divided the part-level action parsing into three stages: 1) person detection, where a person detector is adopted to detect all persons from videos as well as performs instance-level action recognition; 2) Part parsing, where a part-parsing model is proposed to recognize human parts from detected person images; and 3) Action parsing, where a multi-modal action parsing network is used to parse action category conditioning on all detection results that are obtained from previous stages. With these three major models applied, our approach of DAP records a global mean of $0.605$ score in 2021 Kinetics-TPS Challenge.</p></details> |  | None |

This could be possible because, with video, the temporal dimension poses significant additional challenges in gradient estimation. Query-efficient black-box attacks rely on effectively estimated gradients towards maximizing the probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we demonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing the temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations. Specifically, we design a novel iterative algorithm Geometric TRAnsformed Perturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classification models. GEO-TRAP employs standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space for effective gradients into searching for a small group of parameters that define these operations. This group of parameters describes the geometric progression of gradients, resulting in a reduced and structured search space. Our algorithm inherently leads to successful perturbations with surprisingly few queries. For example, adversarial examples generated from GEO-TRAP have better attack success rates with ~73.55% fewer queries compared to the state-of-the-art method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester dataset. Overall, our algorithm exposes vulnerabilities of diverse video classification models and achieves new state-of-the-art results under black-box settings on two large datasets.

The aim is to predict whether a magnetic active region (AR) will originate solar flares above a certain class within a certain amount of time. A crucial issue is concerned with the way the adopted machine learning method is implemented, since forecasting results strongly depend on the criterion with which training, validation, and test sets are populated. In this paper we propose a general paradigm to generate these sets in such a way that they are independent from each other and internally well-balanced in terms of AR flaring effectiveness. This set generation process provides a ground for comparison for the performance assessment of machine learning algorithms. Finally, we use this implementation paradigm in the case of a deep neural network, which takes as input videos of magnetograms recorded by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the solar flare forecasting problem is addressed by means of a deep neural network for video classification, which does not require any a priori extraction of features from the HMI magnetograms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Closer Look at Few-Shot Video Classification: A New Baseline and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12358v1)** | 2021-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing few-shot video classification methods often employ a meta-learning paradigm by designing customized temporal alignment module for similarity calculation. While significant progress has been made, these methods fail to focus on learning effective representations, and heavily rely on the ImageNet pre-training, which might be unreasonable for the few-shot recognition setting due to semantics overlap. In this paper, we aim to present an in-depth study on few-shot video classification by making three contributions. First, we perform a consistent comparative study on the existing metric-based methods to figure out their limitations in representation learning. Accordingly, we propose a simple classifier-based baseline without any temporal alignment that surprisingly outperforms the state-of-the-art meta-learning based methods. Second, we discover that there is a high correlation between the novel action class and the ImageNet object class, which is problematic in the few-shot recognition setting. Our results show that the performance of training from scratch drops significantly, which implies that the existing benchmarks cannot provide enough base data. Finally, we present a new benchmark with more base data to facilitate future few-shot video classification without pre-training.

Comparing with commonly used 3D networks, VidTr is able to aggregate spatio-temporal information via stacked attentions and provide better performance with higher efficiency. We first introduce the vanilla video transformer and show that transformer module is able to perform spatio-temporal modeling from raw pixels, but with heavy memory usage. We then present VidTr which reduces the memory cost by 3.3$\times$ while keeping the same performance. To further optimize the model, we propose the standard deviation based topK pooling for attention ($pool_{topK\_std}$), which reduces the computation by dropping non-informative features along temporal dimension. VidTr achieves state-of-the-art performance on five commonly used datasets with lower computational requirement, showing both the efficiency and effectiveness of our design. Finally, error analysis and visualization show that VidTr is especially good at predicting actions that require long-term temporal reasoning.</p></details> | ICCV 2021 Accepted | None |

Although significant progress has been made in the image domain, few-shot video classification is relatively unexplored. We argue that previous methods underestimate the importance of video feature learning and propose to learn spatiotemporal features using a 3D CNN. Proposing a two-stage approach that learns video features on base classes followed by fine-tuning the classifiers on novel classes, we show that this simple baseline approach outperforms prior few-shot video classification methods by over 20 points on existing benchmarks. To circumvent the need of labeled examples, we present two novel approaches that yield further improvement. First, we leverage tag-labeled videos from a large dataset using tag retrieval followed by selecting the best clips with visual similarities. Second, we learn generative adversarial networks that generate video features of novel classes from their semantic embeddings. Moreover, we find existing benchmarks are limited because they only focus on 5 novel classes in each testing episode and introduce more realistic benchmarks by involving more novel classes, i.e. few-shot learning, as well as a mixture of novel and base classes, i.e. generalized few-shot learning. The experimental results show that our retrieval and feature generation approach significantly outperform the baseline approach on the new benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI in October, 2021</p></details> | None |

In this work, we examine something important that has been less frequently explored: We develop methods to test if the visual driving scene can be used to estimate a drivers' subjective stress levels. For this purpose, we use the AffectiveROAD video recordings and their corresponding stress labels, a continuous human-driver-provided stress metric. We use the common class discretization for stress, dividing its continuous values into three classes: low, medium, and high. We design and evaluate three computer vision modeling approaches to classify the driver's stress levels: (1) object presence features, where features are computed using automatic scene segmentation; (2) end-to-end image classification; and (3) end-to-end video classification. All three approaches show promising results, suggesting that it is possible to approximate the drivers' subjective stress from the information found in the visual scene. We observe that the video classification, which processes the temporal information integrated with the visual information, obtains the highest accuracy of $0.72$, compared to a random baseline accuracy of $0.33$ when tested on a set of nine drivers.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast to static methods that repeat the quantization process and train different models for different constraints, adaptive quantization enables us to flexibly adjust the bit-widths of a single deep network during inference for instant adaptation in different scenarios. While existing research shows encouraging results on common image classification benchmarks, this paper investigates how to train such adaptive networks more effectively. Specifically, we present two novel techniques for quantizing deep neural networks with adaptive bit-widths of weights and activations. First, we propose a collaborative strategy to choose a high-precision teacher for transferring knowledge to the low-precision student while jointly optimizing the model with all bit-widths. Second, to effectively transfer knowledge, we develop a dynamic block swapping method by randomly replacing the blocks in the lower-precision student network with the corresponding blocks in the higher-precision teacher network. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets including video classification benchmarks for the first time, well demonstrate the efficacy of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VideoDG: Generalizing Temporal Relations in Videos to Novel Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03716v2)** | 2021-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces video domain generalization where most video classification networks degenerate due to the lack of exposure to the target domains of divergent distributions. We observe that the global temporal features are less generalizable, due to the temporal domain shift that videos from other unseen domains may have an unexpected absence or misalignment of the temporal relations. This finding has motivated us to solve video domain generalization by effectively learning the local-relation features of different timescales that are more generalizable, and exploiting them along with the global-relation features to maintain the discriminability. This paper presents the VideoDG framework with two technical contributions. The first is a new deep architecture named the Adversarial Pyramid Network, which improves the generalizability of video features by capturing the local-relation, global-relation, and cross-relation features progressively. On the basis of pyramid features, the second contribution is a new and robust approach of adversarial data augmentation that can bridge different video domains by improving the diversity and quality of augmented data. We construct three video domain generalization benchmarks in which domains are divided according to different datasets, different consequences of actions, or different camera views, respectively. VideoDG consistently outperforms the combinations of previous video classification models and existing domain generalization methods on all benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI, 2021.

Our challenge includes two tasks: video structuring in the temporal dimension and multi-modal video classification. It asks the participants to accurately predict both the scene boundaries and the multi-label categories of each scene based on a fine-grained and ads-related category hierarchy. Therefore, our task has four distinguishing features from previous ones: ads domain, multi-modal information, temporal segmentation, and multi-label classification. It will advance the foundation of ads video understanding and have a significant impact on many ads applications like video recommendation. This paper presents an overview of our challenge, including the background of ads videos, an elaborate description of task and dataset, evaluation protocol, and our proposed baseline. By ablating the key components of our baseline, we would like to reveal the main challenges of this task and provide useful guidance for future research of this area.

| **[When Video Classification Meets Incremental Classes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15827v2)** | 2021-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of social media, tremendous videos with new classes are generated daily, which raise an urgent demand for video classification methods that can continuously update new classes while maintaining the knowledge of old videos with limited storage and computing resources. In this paper, we summarize this task as Class-Incremental Video Classification (CIVC) and propose a novel framework to address it. As a subarea of incremental learning tasks, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting is unavoidable in CIVC. To better alleviate it, we utilize some characteristics of videos. First, we decompose the spatio-temporal knowledge before distillation rather than treating it as a whole in the knowledge transfer process; trajectory is also used to refine the decomposition. Second, we propose a dual granularity exemplar selection method to select and store representative video instances of old classes and key-frames inside videos under a tight storage budget. We benchmark our method and previous SOTA class-incremental learning methods on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics datasets, and our method outperforms previous methods significantly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Goal-driven text descriptions for images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12575v1)** | 2021-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A big part of achieving Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) is to build a machine that can see and listen like humans. Much work has focused on designing models for image classification, video classification, object detection, pose estimation, speech recognition, etc., and has achieved significant progress in recent years thanks to deep learning. However, understanding the world is not enough. An AI agent also needs to know how to talk, especially how to communicate with a human. While perception (vision, for example) is more common across animal species, the use of complicated language is unique to humans and is one of the most important aspects of intelligence. In this thesis, we focus on generating textual output given visual input. In Chapter 3, we focus on generating the referring expression, a text description for an object in the image so that a receiver can infer which object is being described. We use a comprehension machine to directly guide the generated referring expressions to be more discriminative. In Chapter 4, we introduce a method that encourages discriminability in image caption generation. We show that more discriminative captioning models generate more descriptive captions. In Chapter 5, we study how training objectives and sampling methods affect the models' ability to generate diverse captions. We find that a popular captioning training strategy will be detrimental to the diversity of generated captions. In Chapter 6, we propose a model that can control the length of generated captions. By changing the desired length, one can influence the style and descriptiveness of the captions. Finally, in Chapter 7, we rank/generate informative image tags according to their information utility. The proposed method better matches what humans think are the most important tags for the images.</p></details> | Ph.D. thesis | None |
| **[A Unified Taxonomy and Multimodal Dataset for Events in Invasion Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11149v2)** | 2021-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic detection of events in complex sports games like soccer and handball using positional or video data is of large interest in research and industry. One requirement is a fundamental understanding of underlying concepts, i.e., events that occur on the pitch. Previous work often deals only with so-called low-level events based on well-defined rules such as free kicks, free throws, or goals. High-level events, such as passes, are less frequently approached due to a lack of consistent definitions. This introduces a level of ambiguity that necessities careful validation when regarding event annotations. Yet, this validation step is usually neglected as the majority of studies adopt annotations from commercial providers on private datasets of unknown quality and focuses on soccer only. To address these issues, we present (1) a universal taxonomy that covers a wide range of low and high-level events for invasion games and is exemplarily refined to soccer and handball, and (2) release two multi-modal datasets comprising video and positional data with gold-standard annotations to foster research in fine-grained and ball-centered event spotting. Experiments on human performance demonstrate the robustness of the proposed taxonomy, and that disagreements and ambiguities in the annotation increase with the complexity of the event. An I3D model for video classification is adopted for event spotting and reveals the potential for benchmarking.

| **[Two-stream Convolutional Networks for Multi-frame Face Anti-spoofing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04032v1)** | 2021-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anti-spoofing is an important task to protect the security of face recognition. Most of previous work either struggle to capture discriminative and generalizable feature or rely on auxiliary information which is unavailable for most of industrial product. Inspired by the video classification work, we propose an efficient two-stream model to capture the key differences between live and spoof faces, which takes multi-frames and RGB difference as input respectively. Feature pyramid modules with two opposite fusion directions and pyramid pooling modules are applied to enhance feature representation. We evaluate the proposed method on the datasets of Siw, Oulu-NPU, CASIA-MFSD and Replay-Attack. The results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on most of datasets' protocol with much less parameter size.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Token Shift Transformer for Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02432v1)** | 2021-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer achieves remarkable successes in understanding 1 and 2-dimensional signals (e.g., NLP and Image Content Understanding). As a potential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of strong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and flexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders naturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise self-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the complex 3-dimensional video signals. This paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel, zero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within each transformer encoder. Specifically, the TokShift barely temporally shifts partial [Class] token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames. Then, we densely plug the module into each encoder of a plain 2D vision transformer for learning 3D video representation. It is worth noticing that our TokShift transformer is a pure convolutional-free video transformer pilot with computational efficiency for video understanding. Experiments on standard benchmarks verify its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Particularly, with input clips of 8/12 frames, the TokShift transformer achieves SOTA precision: 79.83%/80.40% on the Kinetics-400, 66.56% on EGTEA-Gaze+, and 96.80% on UCF-101 datasets, comparable or better than existing SOTA convolutional counterparts.

| **[TAEN: Temporal Aware Embedding Network for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10141v2)** | 2021-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of new class entities requires collecting and annotating hundreds or thousands of samples that is often prohibitively costly. Few-shot learning suggests learning to classify new classes using just a few examples. Only a small number of studies address the challenge of few-shot learning on spatio-temporal patterns such as videos. In this paper, we present the Temporal Aware Embedding Network (TAEN) for few-shot action recognition, that learns to represent actions, in a metric space as a trajectory, conveying both short term semantics and longer term connectivity between action parts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAEN on two few shot tasks, video classification and temporal action detection and evaluate our method on the Kinetics-400 and on ActivityNet 1.2 few-shot benchmarks. With training of just a few fully connected layers we reach comparable results to prior art on both few shot video classification and temporal detection tasks, while reaching state-of-the-art in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Grained AutoAugmentation for Multi-Label Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05384v2)** | 2021-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is a commonly used approach to improving the generalization of deep learning models. Recent works show that learned data augmentation policies can achieve better generalization than hand-crafted ones. However, most of these works use unified augmentation policies for all samples in a dataset, which is observed not necessarily beneficial for all labels in multi-label classification tasks, i.e., some policies may have negative impacts on some labels while benefitting the others. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Label-Based AutoAugmentation (LB-Aug) method for multi-label scenarios, where augmentation policies are generated with respect to labels by an augmentation-policy network. The policies are learned via reinforcement learning using policy gradient methods, providing a mapping from instance labels to their optimal augmentation policies. Numerical experiments show that our LB-Aug outperforms previous state-of-the-art augmentation methods by large margins in multiple benchmarks on image and video classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Space-Time Attention All You Need for Video Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05095v4)** | 2021-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively on self-attention over space and time. Our method, named "TimeSformer," adapts the standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning directly from a sequence of frame-level patches. Our experimental study compares different self-attention schemes and suggests that "divided attention," where temporal attention and spatial attention are separately applied within each block, leads to the best video classification accuracy among the design choices considered. Despite the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute long).

| **[Over-the-Air Adversarial Flickering Attacks against Video Recognition Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05123v4)** | 2021-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for video classification, just like image classification networks, may be subjected to adversarial manipulation. The main difference between image classifiers and video classifiers is that the latter usually use temporal information contained within the video. In this work we present a manipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering temporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers and is implementable in the real world. After demonstrating the manipulation of action classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make universal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition, we generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant perturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the perturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models and the transferability of the attack was demonstrated. These properties allow us to bridge the gap between simulated environment and real-world application, as will be demonstrated in this paper for the first time for an over-the-air flickering attack.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CT-Net: Channel Tensorization Network for Video Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01603v1)** | 2021-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D convolution is powerful for video classification but often computationally expensive, recent studies mainly focus on decomposing it on spatial-temporal and/or channel dimensions. Unfortunately, most approaches fail to achieve a preferable balance between convolutional efficiency and feature-interaction sufficiency. For this reason, we propose a concise and novel Channel Tensorization Network (CT-Net), by treating the channel dimension of input feature as a multiplication of K sub-dimensions. On one hand, it naturally factorizes convolution in a multiple dimension way, leading to a light computation burden. On the other hand, it can effectively enhance feature interaction from different channels, and progressively enlarge the 3D receptive field of such interaction to boost classification accuracy. Furthermore, we equip our CT-Module with a Tensor Excitation (TE) mechanism. It can learn to exploit spatial, temporal and channel attention in a high-dimensional manner, to improve the cooperative power of all the feature dimensions in our CT-Module. Finally, we flexibly adapt ResNet as our CT-Net. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging video benchmarks, e.g., Kinetics-400, Something-Something V1 and V2. Our CT-Net outperforms a number of recent SOTA approaches, in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency.

This biological mechanism, more specifically saliency detection, has long been used in multimedia indexing to drive the analysis only on relevant parts of images or videos for further processing. The recent advent of silicon retinas (or event cameras -- sensors that measure pixel-wise changes in brightness and output asynchronous events accordingly) raises the question of how to adapt attention and saliency to the unconventional type of such sensors' output. Silicon retina aims to reproduce the biological retina behaviour. In that respect, they produce punctual events in time that can be construed as neural spikes and interpreted as such by a neural network. In particular, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent an asynchronous type of artificial neural network closer to biology than traditional artificial networks, mainly because they seek to mimic the dynamics of neural membrane and action potentials over time. SNNs receive and process information in the form of spike trains. Therefore, they make for a suitable candidate for the efficient processing and classification of incoming event patterns measured by silicon retinas. In this paper, we review the biological background behind the attentional mechanism, and introduce a case study of event videos classification with SNNs, using a biology-grounded low-level computational attention mechanism, with interesting preliminary results.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[A Study On the Effects of Pre-processing On Spatio-temporal Action Recognition Using Spiking Neural Networks Trained with STDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14740v1)** | 2021-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been an increasing interest in spiking neural networks in recent years. SNNs are seen as hypothetical solutions for the bottlenecks of ANNs in pattern recognition, such as energy efficiency. But current methods such as ANN-to-SNN conversion and back-propagation do not take full advantage of these networks, and unsupervised methods have not yet reached a success comparable to advanced artificial neural networks. It is important to study the behavior of SNNs trained with unsupervised learning methods such as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on video classification tasks, including mechanisms to model motion information using spikes, as this information is critical for video understanding. This paper presents multiple methods of transposing temporal information into a static format, and then transforming the visual information into spikes using latency coding. These methods are paired with two types of temporal fusion known as early and late fusion, and are used to help the spiking neural network in capturing the spatio-temporal features from videos. In this paper, we rely on the network architecture of a convolutional spiking neural network trained with STDP, and we test the performance of this network when challenged with action recognition tasks. Understanding how a spiking neural network responds to different methods of movement extraction and representation can help reduce the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. In this paper we show the effect of the similarity in the shape and speed of certain actions on action recognition with spiking neural networks, we also highlight the effectiveness of some methods compared to others.</p></details> |  | None |
