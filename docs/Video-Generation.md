While prior works have advanced the field, they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents. To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: \url{https://yuyangyin.github.io/PanoWorld-X/}</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yuyangyin.github.io/PanoWorld-X) |
| **[SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Wan-Alpha: High-Quality Text-to-Video Generation with Alpha Channel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24979v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands. The released model is available on our website: \href{https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/}{https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha) |
| **[BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

| **[Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for \textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Physical Plausibility in Video Generation by Reasoning the Implausibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24702v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it. Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SANA-Video: Efficient Video Generation with Block Linear Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24695v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Object-Centric Representations Based on Slots in Real World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24652v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity. We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision. Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, overlap with arXiv:2507.20855 and arXiv:2501.15878</p></details> | None |
| **[UI2V-Bench: An Understanding-based Image-to-video Generation Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24427v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V) generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However, existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.

| **[NeRV-Diffusion: Diffuse Implicit Neural Representations for Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24353v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode. 2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights. In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between frames or videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nerv-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[FreeAction: Training-Free Techniques for Enhanced Fidelity of Trajectory-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24241v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[Autoregressive Video Generation beyond Next Frames Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24081v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame, extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. Among these designs, we find model video generation using \textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers. The code and weights are released at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VFRTok.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VFRTok) |
| **[Half-order Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Model: A Recursive Likelihood Ratio Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00639v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation, respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a Half-Order (HO) fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The HO gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with lower variance than other methods. We theoretically investigate the bias, variance, and convergence of our method. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QuantSparse: Comprehensively Compressing Video Diffusion Transformer with Model Quantization and Attention Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23681v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment. Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains, but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity. Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$} reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end inference. Our code will be released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantSparse.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantSparse) |
| **[SimpleGVR: A Simple Baseline for Latent-Cascaded Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19838v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VividFace: High-Quality and Efficient One-Step Diffusion For Video Face Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23584v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance. Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency, we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering practical resources for the research community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Action2Dialogue: Generating Character-Centric Narratives from Scene-Level Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16819v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures; revised supplementary document, etc</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image.

To address this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures. Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications. As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.</p></details> |  | None |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168 human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc), while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deeptracereward.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, model, and demos are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive) |

To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**, a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves **absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by **+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot, the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover, performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website) |

While studies propose acceleration methods to reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability. We introduce Astraea, a framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation under a performance target. At its core, Astraea proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-friendly sparse attention strategy, enabling linear savings on execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. Meanwhile, to determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, Astraea achieves up to 2.4$\times$ inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2$\times$ speedup on 8 GPUs) while achieving up to over 10~dB video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods ($<$0.5\% loss on VBench compared to baselines).</p></details> |  | None |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity.

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network.We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts.

In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion, making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation. However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the original audio.

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  | None |

While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization.

However, current video generation methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided, variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete, coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation, guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts.

Inspired by this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling.

Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  | None |

We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  | None |

User studies show 74--83% preference for our physics-enhanced videos. It also reduces warping error by 22--37% (depending on the backbone) and improves temporal consistency scores.

ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,Project website: https://ctrlhair-arxiv.netlify.app/</p></details> | None |

Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control.</p></details> | <details><summary>All d...</summary><p>All data and code is available at https://github.com/pandayuanyu/NewtonGen</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/pandayuanyu/NewtonGen) |

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 | None |

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

However, existing methods predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue, we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 | None |
| **[Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via Semantic-Aware Permutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18875v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SparseDiT: Token Sparsification for Efficient Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06028v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality. We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency.

Most existing methods only produce partial scenes and provide limited navigational freedom. We introduce a practical and scalable solution that uses 360{\deg} video as an intermediate scene representation, capturing the full-scene context and ensuring consistent visual content throughout the generation. We propose WorldPrompter, a generative pipeline that synthesizes traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach streamlines the 3D graphic design workflow, enabling flexible design exploration and rapid production of deliverables. A straightforward approach to synthesizing a video from coarse geometry might condition a video diffusion model on geometric structure. However, existing video diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex scenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and temporal consistency. To address this, we propose a generative framework that leverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models. Specifically, our framework consists of a Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG) and a Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module generates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image diffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these anchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using a video diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural guidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene models and natural images, which is extremely difficult to obtain. Comprehensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality, style-consistent scene videos under diverse and challenging scenarios, outperforming simple and extended baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kimgeonung.github.io/VideoFrom3D/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kimgeonung.github.io/VideoFrom3D) |

Prior work has largely focused on static image reconstruction, leaving the open question of whether EEG carries sufficient information for dynamic video decoding. In this work, we present EEGVid, a framework that reconstructs dynamic video stimuli from EEG signals while systematically probing the information they encode. Our approach first learns the EEG representation and then uses these features for video synthesis with a temporally conditioned StyleGAN-ADA that maps EEG embeddings to specific frame positions. Through experiments on three datasets (SEED, EEG-Video Action, SEED-DV), we demonstrate that EEG supports semantically meaningful reconstruction of dynamic visual content, and we quantify \emph{how much EEG knows}: (i) hemispheric asymmetry, with the left hemisphere more predictive of visual content and the right hemisphere of emotional content, (ii) the temporal lobe as the most informative region, and (iii) EEG timesteps 100--300 as the most critical for dynamic visual encoding. Importantly, while generative priors contribute fine spatial detail, EEG provides the semantic and temporal guidance necessary for reconstructing videos that align with the observed stimuli. This positions video generation not as a standalone generative benchmark, but as a means to visualize and validate the representational content of EEG in the context of dynamic vision.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing watermarking methods demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time. I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video. \href{https://github.com/MrCrims/I2VWM-Robust-Watermarking-for-Image-to-Video-Generation}{Code Released.}</p></details> | 10 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/MrCrims/I2VWM-Robust-Watermarking-for-Image-to-Video-Generation) |

However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Effective compression of models has become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. After experiments and analysis, we identify two key obstacles to low-bit PTQ for DiTs: (1) the weights of DiT models follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant quantization errors. This issue has been observed in the linear layer weights of different DiT models, which deeply limits the performance. (2) two types of activation outliers in DiT models: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate post-training quantization framework for image and video generation. First, we introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that allocates more quantization intervals to the intermediate dense regions, effectively achieving alignment with the weight distribution and reducing quantization errors. Second, we propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers.Extensive experiments on various text-to-image and text-to-video DiT models demonstrate that LRQ-DiT preserves high generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection.

Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments.

Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent. To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories.

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> | None |

To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ewrfcas/Uni3C.

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

These approaches often utilize large models that require significant training resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale. Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of algorithmic latency.</p></details> |  | None |

The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space.

Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance.

Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04705v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures.

However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often generate only a single dominant color, missing emotion variation. Others rely on indirect mappings through text or images, resulting in the loss of crucial emotion details. To address these challenges, we present Music2Palette, a novel method for emotion-aligned color palette generation via cross-modal representation learning. We first construct MuCED, a dataset of 2,634 expert-validated music-palette pairs aligned through Russell-based emotion vectors. To directly translate music into palettes, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework with a music encoder and color decoder. We further propose a multi-objective optimization approach that jointly enhances emotion alignment, color diversity, and palette coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods in interpreting music emotion and generating attractive and diverse color palettes.

Using only generated videos, the learned policy achieves a 77.3\% success rate on grasping tasks in simulation and demonstrates coherent executions on a real robot.

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation.

These limitations inherent to their video generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input. In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over 68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions: overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC.

| **[PanoLora: Bridging Perspective and Panoramic Video Generation with LoRA Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11092v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K, a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://stablepartdiffusion4d.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Text-to-3D models produce detailed static geometry but lack motion synthesis, while video diffusion models generate motion with temporal and multi-view geometric inconsistencies. T2Bs bridges this gap by leveraging deformable 3D Gaussian splatting to align static 3D assets with video outputs. By constraining motion with static geometry and employing a view-dependent deformation MLP, T2Bs (i) outperforms existing 4D generation methods in accuracy and expressiveness while reducing video artifacts and view inconsistencies, and (ii) reconstructs smooth, coherent, fully registered 3D geometries designed to scale for building morphable models with diverse, realistic facial motions. This enables synthesizing expressive, animatable character heads that surpass current 4D generation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%.

In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Deep Generative Model in Machine Learning: Theory, Principle and Efficacy (DeLTa). 1-frame results for CIFAR10 in Table 2 corrected.

However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics.

However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Byted...</summary><p>Bytedance Seed Technical Report</p></details> | None |

However, these models primarily animate static images without extending beyond their provided context. Introducing additional constraints, such as camera trajectories, can enhance diversity but often degrade visual quality, limiting their applicability for tasks requiring faithful scene representation. We propose CamC2V, a context-to-video (C2V) model that integrates multiple image conditions as context with 3D constraints alongside camera control to enrich both global semantics and fine-grained visual details. This enables more coherent and context-aware video generation. Moreover, we motivate the necessity of temporal awareness for an effective context representation. Our comprehensive study on the RealEstate10K dataset demonstrates improvements in visual quality and camera controllability. We will publish our code upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance and improving generative video quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation.

Existing methods struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text, reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control, we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness.

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Utilizing open-source resources from Llama 3, we train the DirectorLLM to generate detailed instructional signals, such as human poses, to guide video generation. This approach offloads the simulation of human motion from the video generator to the LLM, effectively creating informative outlines for human-centric scenes. These signals are used as conditions by the video renderer, facilitating more realistic and prompt-following video generation. As an independent LLM module, it can be applied to different video renderers, including UNet and DiT, with minimal effort.

To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation.

A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB.

To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom) |

However, existing surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the comprehensive applications of digital humans.

Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality.

As a result, the field of video production is undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models are typically constrained by high computational costs. In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design. These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos. By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%. Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and customization. The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions. Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator, significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding. Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

| **[Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://primecai.github.io/moc/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://primecai.github.io/moc) |

Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pose-paper.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is indispensable for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, flexible adjustment of visual attributes, such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features, is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to representative baseline methods in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/binjiezhang/Ego-PM (branch: main)</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/binjiezhang/Ego-PM) |

However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy computational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

However, they often fall short in more complex film and television productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan. Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions. Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the impact of lighting is deeply coupled with other factors of videos, e.g., objects and scenes. Thus, it remains challenging to disentangle and model coherent lighting conditions independently, limiting the flexibility to control lighting in video generation. In this paper, inspired by the established controllable T2I models, we propose LumiSculpt, which enables precise and consistent lighting control in T2V generation models. LumiSculpt equips the video generation with new interactive capabilities, allowing the input of reference image sequences with customized lighting conditions. Furthermore, the core learnable plug-and-play module of LumiSculpt facilitates direct control over the intensity, position and trajectory of an assumed light source in video diffusion models. To effectively train LumiSculpt and address the issue of insufficient lighting data, we construct LumiHuman, a new lightweight and flexible dataset for portrait lighting of images and videos. Experimental results demonstrate that LumiSculpt achieves precise and high-quality lighting control in video generation. The analysis demonstrates the flexibility of LumiHuman.</p></details> |  | None |

The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos, limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://hywang2002.github.io/MoCo</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hywang2002.github.io/MoCo) |

These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks.

Our approach incorporates three core innovations: (1) a scalable data pipeline curating 100k-hour multimodal datasets through automated annotation; (2) a representation alignment strategy using self-supervised audio features to guide latent diffusion training, efficiently improving audio quality and generation stability; (3) a novel multimodal diffusion transformer resolving modal competition, containing dual-stream audio-video fusion through joint attention, and textual semantic injection via cross-attention.

In this work, we investigate the effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline.

However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~group-inference, GitHub: https://github.com/GaParmar/group-inference</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/GaParmar/group-inference) |

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis.

Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational cost.

| **[Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06593v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) video acquisition using the alternating exposure (AE) paradigm has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness with a single consumer camera. However, despite progress driven by deep neural networks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world applications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this challenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we propose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal luminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the inherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an asynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure control across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically required in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, showing the remarkable potential of our solution in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR) |

However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first three authors.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.</p></details> |  | None |

Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |
| **[Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and video generation, making them attractive for network optimization tasks. In this paper, we propose xDiff, a diffusion-based reinforcement learning(RL) framework for inter-cell interference management (ICIM) in O-RAN. We first formulate ICIM as a resource allocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing a user-defined reward function and then develop an online learning solution by integrating a diffusion model into an RL framework for near-real-time policy generation. Particularly, we introduce a novel metric, preference values, as the policy representation to enable efficient policy-guided resource allocation within O-RAN distributed units (DUs). We implement xDiff on a 5G testbed consisting of three cells and a set of smartphones in two small-cell scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that xDiff outperforms state-of-the-art ICIM approaches, highlighting the potential of diffusion models for online optimization of O-RAN.

However, conventional video dubbing techniques remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

This innovative approach reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.

Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency.

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

During translation, it is essential to preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen, an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation.

However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies.

However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark.

Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.</p></details> | 27 pages, 20 figures | None |
| **[M2DAO-Talker: Harmonizing Multi-granular Motion Decoupling and Alternating Optimization for Talking-head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08307v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

Previous approaches have achieved similar results either by out-painting 2D views of a scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry-which quickly accumulates errors-or by using video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a memory module that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost required to use all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 highlight.

However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.

| **[EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video generation paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://haroldchen19.github.io/PhysHPO-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://haroldchen19.github.io/PhysHPO-Page) |

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats.

However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

| **[From Large Angles to Consistent Faces: Identity-Preserving Video Generation via Mixture of Facial Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09476v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment.

| **[Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16587v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression, one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses, and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised, end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained, semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Turbo-VAED: Fast and Stable Transfer of Video-VAEs to Mobile Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09136v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3) We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs, Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED) |

We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Banding Artifacts on Compressed Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08700v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there have been notable advancements in video compression technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND) |

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://causvid.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[REDUCIO! Generating 1K Video within 16 Seconds using Extremely Compressed Motion Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13552v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation. More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024$\times$1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

| **[Yan: Foundational Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08601v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.
