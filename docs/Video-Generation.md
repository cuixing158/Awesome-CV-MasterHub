| **[Video2Act: A Dual-System Video Diffusion Policy with Robotic Spatio-Motional Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03044v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OneThinker: All-in-one Reasoning Model for Image and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03043v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/OneThinker</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/tulerfeng/OneThinker) |
| **[MultiShotMaster: A Controllable Multi-Shot Video Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03041v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qinghew.github.io/MultiShotMaster</p></details> | [Code Link](https://qinghew.github.io/MultiShotMaster) |
| **[Video4Spatial: Towards Visuospatial Intelligence with Context-Guided Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03040v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://xizaoqu.github.io/video4spatial/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xizaoqu.github.io/video4spatial) |
| **[ViSAudio: End-to-End Video-Driven Binaural Spatial Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03036v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

| **[MAViD: A Multimodal Framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03034v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD) |
| **[SMP: Reusable Score-Matching Motion Priors for Physics-Based Character Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03028v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

| **[Instant Video Models: Universal Adapters for Stabilizing Image-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03014v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |
| **[In-Context Sync-LoRA for Portrait Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03013v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sagipolaczek.github.io/Sync-LoRA/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sagipolaczek.github.io/Sync-LoRA) |
| **[Benchmarking Scientific Understanding and Reasoning for Video Generation using VideoScience-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02942v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena. Our data and evaluation code are available at: \href{https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/VideoScience}{github.com/hao-ai-lab/VideoScience}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/VideoScience) |
| **[LoVoRA: Text-guided and Mask-free Video Object Removal and Addition with Learnable Object-aware Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02933v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Taming Camera-Controlled Video Generation with Verifiable Geometry Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02870v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Action Anticipation at a Glimpse: To What Extent Can Multimodal Cues Replace Video?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02846v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2026 - Applications Track</p></details> | None |
| **[ReVSeg: Incentivizing the Reasoning Chain for Video Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02835v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; 15 pages, 16 figures</p></details> | None |

Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members.

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion for Hateful Video Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02743v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing construction methods either depend on labor-intensive expert reasoning or on fully automated systems lacking expert involvement, creating a tension between scalability and interpretability. We introduce \textbf{XISM}, an interactive system that combines data-driven inference with expert knowledge. XISM generates candidate maps via a top-down procedure and allows users to iteratively refine edges in a visual interface, with real-time metric feedback. Experiments in three semantic domains and expert interviews show that XISM improves linguistic decision transparency and controllability in semantic-map construction while maintaining computational efficiency. XISM provides a collaborative approach for scalable and interpretable semantic-map building.

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02650v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Co-speech Gesture Video Generation via Motion-Based Graph Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02576v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/does-hearing-help-seeing/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects) |

Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation.

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally to this work.

| **[Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02268v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

| **[Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://splatsure.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>codes...</summary><p>codes:https://github.com/wufan-cse/IC-World</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/wufan-cse/IC-World) |

We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gravity-eval.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://edit-by-track.github.io</p></details> | None |

We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tuna-ai.org/</p></details> | None |

However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks.

We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI.

We introduce CP-Bench, a minimal and fully controlled benchmark designed to isolate this capability using an extremely simple task: counting identical cubes in a synthetic scene while the camera moves and only reveals subsets of objects at any moment. Despite the simplicity of the setting, we find that state-of-the-art open-source and commercial models, including Qwen-3-VL, InternVL3, GPT-5, and Gemini-3-Pro, fail dramatically. A static-camera control variant confirms that the failure arises not from object recognition but from an inability to accumulate evidence across time. Further experiments show that neither higher sampling FPS, perception- or spatial-enhanced models, nor finetuning with additional videos leads to meaningful cross-temporal generalization. Our results reveal a fundamental limitation in modern multimodal architectures and training paradigms. CP-Bench provides a simple yet powerful diagnostic tool and establishes a clean testbed for developing models capable of genuine time-consistent visual reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output.

Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, Project in https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://01yzzyu.github.io/script.github.io) |

This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop LaMAS</p></details> | [Code Link](https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page) |
| **[JPEGs Just Got Snipped: Croppable Signatures Against Deepfake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01845v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes are a type of synthetic media created using artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms. This technology can for example superimpose faces and voices onto videos, creating hyper-realistic but artificial representations. Deepfakes pose significant risks regarding misinformation and fake news, because they can spread false information by depicting public figures saying or doing things they never did, undermining public trust. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages BLS signatures (Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham 2004) to implement signatures that remain valid after image cropping, but are invalidated in all the other types of manipulation, including deepfake creation. Our approach does not require who crops the image to know the signature private key or to be trusted in general, and it is O(1) in terms of signature size, making it a practical solution for scenarios where images are disseminated through web servers and cropping is the primary transformation. Finally, we adapted the signature scheme for the JPEG standard, and we experimentally tested the size of a signed image.</p></details> |  | None |

However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models. Our dataset, training code, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx) |
| **[Seeing through Imagination: Learning Scene Geometry via Implicit Spatial World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01821v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures and 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative Action Tell-Tales: Assessing Human Motion in Synthesized Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01803v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating SAM2 for Video Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01774v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures and 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a report submitted as part of PhD proposal defense of Hafsa Billah</p></details> | None |
| **[RDTF: Resource-efficient Dual-mask Training Framework for Multi-frame Animated Sticker Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17735v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, significant advancements have been achieved in video generation technology, but applying it to resource-constrained downstream tasks like multi-frame animated sticker generation (ASG) characterized by low frame rates, abstract semantics, and long tail frame length distribution-remains challenging. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter, LoRA) for large pre-trained models suffer from insufficient fitting ability and source-domain knowledge interference. In this paper, we propose Resource-Efficient Dual-Mask Training Framework (RDTF), a dedicated solution for multi-frame ASG task under resource constraints. We argue that training a compact model from scratch with million-level samples outperforms PEFT on large models, with RDTF realizing this via three core designs: 1) a Discrete Frame Generation Network (DFGN) optimized for low-frame-rate ASG, ensuring parameter efficiency; 2) a dual-mask based data utilization strategy to enhance the availability and diversity of limited data; 3) a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method that decomposes sample entropy into static and adaptive components, enabling easy-to-difficult training convergence. To provide high-quality data support for RDTFs training from scratch, we construct VSD2M-a million-level multi-modal animated sticker dataset with rich annotations (static and animated stickers, action-focused text descriptions)-filling the gap of dedicated animated data for ASG task. Experiments demonstrate that RDTF is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to state-of-the-art PEFT methods (e.g., I2V-Adapter, SimDA) on ASG tasks, verifying the feasibility of our framework under resource constraints.</p></details> | Submitted to TMM | None |
| **[StreamGaze: Gaze-Guided Temporal Reasoning and Proactive Understanding in Streaming Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01707v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://streamgaze.github.io/</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design.

Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |

Beyond image signals, systematic data loss, noise pollution, and audio file corruption can occur due to the unpredictability of the MRI acquisition environment. In such cases, generating audio from images is critical for data recovery in both clinical and research applications. However, this remains challenging due to hardware constraints, acoustic interference, and data corruption. Existing solutions, such as denoising and multi-stage synthesis methods, face limitations in audio fidelity and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (KE-CVAE), a novel two-step "knowledge enhancement + variational inference" framework for generating speech audio signals from cine dynamic MRI sequences. This approach introduces two key innovations: (1) integration of unlabeled MRI data for knowledge enhancement, and (2) a variational inference architecture to improve generative modeling capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts at synthesizing speech audio directly from dynamic MRI video sequences. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on an open-source dynamic vocal tract MRI dataset recorded during speech. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural speech waveforms while addressing MRI-specific acoustic challenges, outperforming conventional deep learning-based synthesis approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Semantics-Aware Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods face two critical challenges: (1) Strong generalization blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal patterns. Although existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue using memory modules, their rigid prototype-matching process limits adaptability to diverse scenarios; (2) Relying solely on low-level appearance and motion cues makes it difficult to perceive high-level semantic anomalies in complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose SIB-VAD, a novel framework based on adaptive information bottleneck filtering and semantic-aware enhancement. We propose the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) to replace traditional memory modules. It compresses normal features directly into a low-dimensional manifold based on the information bottleneck principle and uses an adaptive routing mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable normal bottleneck subspace. Trained only on normal data, SFFMs only learn normal low-dimensional manifolds, while abnormal features deviate and are effectively filtered. Unlike memory modules, SFFM directly removes abnormal information and adaptively handles scene variations. To improve semantic awareness, we further design a multimodal prediction framework that jointly models appearance, motion, and semantics. Through multimodal consistency constraints and joint error computation, it achieves more robust VAD performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our feature filtering paradigm based on semantics-aware information bottleneck.

However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01342v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or "fuzzy" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches.

| **[DMC$^3$: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction for Egocentric Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20285v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generating Fit Check Videos with a Handheld Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23886v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-captured full-body videos are popular, but most deployments require mounted cameras, carefully-framed shots, and repeated practice. We propose a more convenient solution that enables full-body video capture using handheld mobile devices. Our approach takes as input two static photos (front and back) of you in a mirror, along with an IMU motion reference that you perform while holding your mobile phone, and synthesizes a realistic video of you performing a similar target motion. We enable rendering into a new scene, with consistent illumination and shadows. We propose a novel video diffusion-based model to achieve this. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free frame generation strategy and a multi-reference attention mechanism to effectively integrate appearance information from both the front and back selfies into the video diffusion model. Further, we introduce an image-based fine-tuning strategy to enhance frame sharpness and improve shadows and reflections generation for more realistic human-scene composition.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniFD: A Unified Model for Versatile Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01128v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications.

CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 15 figures, 5 Tables, Accepted at NeurIPS 7HVU Workshop, Accepted at AAAI AI4ED Workshop</p></details> | None |

Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[VLASH: Real-Time VLAs via Future-State-Aware Asynchronous Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01031v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

| **[Goal-Driven Reward by Video Diffusion Models for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00961v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet it often relies on carefully designed programmatic reward functions to guide agent behavior. Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Monocular Human-Object Interaction Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00960v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized robots must learn from diverse, large-scale human-object interactions (HOI) to operate robustly in the real world. Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale dataset to serve as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2026, Project page available at https://dfki-av.github.io/TalkingPose</p></details> | [Code Link](https://dfki-av.github.io/TalkingPose) |

Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack object-level control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce KineMask, an approach for video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predicted scene descriptions, leading to support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Our experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.

We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method in various applications, including motion transfer and video editing.

Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos. Furthermore, we show the potential applications of our approach, including physics-based video generation and editing.

We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing ~8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (VideoLLMs) and find that they achieve low accuracy, generally ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that VideoLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> | None |

While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling. We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.

Art conveys emotion through the joint design of visual and auditory elements, yet most prior work is human-centered or single-modality, overlooking the emotion intentionally expressed by the artwork. Meanwhile, current Audio-Visual Language Models (AVLMs) typically require large-scale audio pretraining to endow Visual Language Models (VLMs) with hearing, which limits scalability. We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs. VAEmotionLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ArtEmoBenchmark, outperforming audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual baselines.

Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

This paper proposes a novel method for addressing this task, called Structured Context Learning, which introduces the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide a structured context for learning temporal information. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and flexible, not restricted to specific temporal models like GRU, LSTM, and Transformers. This flexibility enables our method to achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, we apply SPoS to partition the input frame sequence and provide a structured context for the subsequent temporal model. Notably, SPoS's overall computational complexity is linear with respect to the video length. We next calculate group similarities to capture differences between frames, and a lightweight fully convolutional network is utilized to determine the event boundaries based on the grouped similarity maps. To remedy the ambiguities of boundary annotations, we adapt the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[What about gravity in video generation? Post-Training Newton's Laws with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00425v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet often violate basic physical laws-objects float, accelerations drift, and collisions behave inconsistently-revealing a persistent gap between visual realism and physical realism. We propose $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on $\textit{verifiable rewards}$. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ extracts $\textit{measurable proxies}$ from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, $\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$.

However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This failure arises from a fundamental misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. We propose a semantic video compression framework named DiSCo that transmits only the most meaningful information while relying on generative priors for detail synthesis. The source video is decomposed into three compact modalities: a textual description, a spatiotemporally degraded video, and optional sketches or poses that respectively capture semantic, appearance, and motion cues. A conditional video diffusion model then reconstructs high-quality, temporally coherent videos from these compact representations. Temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs are proposed to improve multimodal generation and modality compactness. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation.

While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.</p></details> | 45 pages, 5 figure | None |

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding.

While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://hkust-c4g.github.io/AnyTalker-homepage</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hkust-c4g.github.io/AnyTalker-homepage) |

As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets.

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively.

However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video.

In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In this paper, we present a self-training based source-free video domain adaptation approach to address this challenge by bridging the gap between the source and the target domains. We use the source pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain samples, which are inevitably noisy. Thus, we treat the problem of source-free video domain adaptation as learning from noisy labels and argue that the samples with correct pseudo-labels can help us in adaptation. To this end, we leverage the cross-entropy loss as an indicator of the correctness of the pseudo-labels and use the resulting small-loss samples from the target domain for fine-tuning the model. We further enhance the adaptation performance by implementing a teacher-student (TS) framework, in which the teacher, which is updated gradually, produces reliable pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, the student undergoes fine-tuning on the target domain videos using these generated pseudo-labels to improve its performance. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our methods, termed as CleanAdapt, CleanAdapt + TS, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming the existing approaches on various open datasets.

Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details.

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mm-robot.github.io/distill_latent_action/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://mm-robot.github.io/distill_latent_action) |

Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 3rd IEEE International Conference of Computational Intelligence and Network Systems 2025</p></details> | None |

By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation.

| **[McSc: Motion-Corrective Preference Alignment for Video Generation with Self-Critic Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22974v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.</p></details> |  | None |

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg) |

However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches.

However, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: 1) incomplete representation of video details, leading to weak alignment, and 2) inadequate temporal and rhythmic correspondence, particularly in achieving precise beat synchronization. To address the challenges, we propose Video Echoed in Music (VeM), a latent music diffusion that generates high-quality soundtracks with semantic, temporal, and rhythmic alignment for input videos. To capture video details comprehensively, VeM employs a hierarchical video parsing that acts as a music conductor, orchestrating multi-level information across modalities. Modality-specific encoders, coupled with a storyboard-guided cross-attention mechanism (SG-CAtt), integrate semantic cues while maintaining temporal coherence through position and duration encoding. For rhythmic precision, the frame-level transition-beat aligner and adapter (TB-As) dynamically synchronize visual scene transitions with music beats. We further contribute a novel video-music paired dataset sourced from e-commerce advertisements and video-sharing platforms, which imposes stricter transition-beat synchronization requirements. Meanwhile, we introduce novel metrics tailored to the task. Experimental results demonstrate superiority, particularly in semantic relevance and rhythmic precision.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

| **[TARFVAE: Efficient One-Step Generative Time Series Forecasting via TARFLOW based VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22853v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> | None |
| **[Captain Safari: A World Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22815v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity.

However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by the recent success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only to predict future frames can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior attempts to read out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning; that strategy is ill-suited for flow, where labeled data is scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models for zero-shot flow extraction. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recently introduced Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time inference procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method is competitive with state-of-the-art, task-specific models on the real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS benchmark and the synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric. Our results show that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is an effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss methods for high-quality flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/projects/kl_tracing</p></details> | [Code Link](https://neuroailab.github.io/projects) |

However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

| **[Fast3Dcache: Training-free 3D Geometry Synthesis Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22533v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method. CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review CVPR 2026 (44 Pages)</p></details> | None |

Animating 3D Gaussian Scenes with Dynamic Weather Effects via Physics-Guided Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05296v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, dynamic editing of such scenes remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel framework, Physics-Guided Score Distillation, to address a fundamental conflict: physics simulation provides a strong motion prior that is insufficient for photorealism , while video-based Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) alone cannot generate coherent motion for complex, multi-particle scenarios. We resolve this through a unified optimization framework where physics simulation guides Score Distillation to jointly refine the motion prior for photorealism while simultaneously optimizing appearance. Specifically, we learn a neural dynamics model that predicts particle motion and appearance, optimized end-to-end via a combined loss integrating Video-SDS for photorealism with our physics-guidance prior. This allows for photorealistic refinements while ensuring the dynamics remain plausible. Our framework enables scene-wide dynamic weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, with physically plausible motion. Experiments demonstrate our physics-guided approach significantly outperforms baselines, with ablations confirming this joint refinement is essential for generating coherent, high-fidelity dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow) |

While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos.

While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet.

Current approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io) |

We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://match-and-fuse.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Existing datasets are narrow, static, and costly to annotate, while synthetic data often yields oversimplified or misaligned behaviors. We present Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts readily available Internet videos of human computer use into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating actions or relying on handcrafted heuristics, we cast trajectory annotation as an inverse dynamics problem that predicts user actions from consecutive screen states, which simplifies learning and generalizes across domains. Through a task-aware retrieval and labeling pipeline, W&L yields over 53K high-quality trajectories that enhance CUAs both as in-context exemplars and as supervised training data. On OSWorld, it consistently improves general-purpose and specialized CUAs, while on WindowsAgentArena it achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale models under the 15-step limit. These results show that web-scale human demonstration videos can serve as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing real-world CUAs.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing VisualTTS models typically adopt lightweight architectures and design specialized modules to achieve the above goals respectively, yet the speech quality is not satisfied due to the model capacity and the limited data in VisualTTS. Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics.</p></details> | MM Asia 2025 | None |
| **[Department-Specific Security Awareness Campaigns: A Cross-Organizational Study of HR and Accounting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22189v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many cyberattacks succeed because they exploit flaws at the human level. To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a "general" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization. In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU.

Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.</p></details> | 8 pages, with supp | None |

However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models.

While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.</p></details> |  | None |

This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spacewalk-18: A Benchmark for Multimodal and Long-form Procedural Video Understanding in Novel Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18773v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from (procedural) videos has increasingly served as a pathway for embodied agents to acquire skills from human demonstrations. To do this, video understanding models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel environments, tasks, and problem domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) video question answering, over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to: (1) generalize to novel domains; (2) utilize long temporal context and multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) information. Our extensive experimental analysis highlights the challenges of Spacewalk-18, but also suggests best practices for domain generalization and long-form understanding. Notably, we discover a promising adaptation via summarization technique that leads to significant performance improvement without model fine-tuning. The Spacewalk-18 benchmark is released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18/.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | [Code Link](https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18) |

Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting with Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16952v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification. Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoGAN: Improving Motion Quality in Video Diffusion via Few-Step Motion Adversarial Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21592v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

| **[Harmony: Harmonizing Audio and Video Generation through Cross-Task Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21579v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  | None |

While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version (NeurIPS 2025).

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding.

However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

The SAM2 model, pretrained on natural videos, offers potential for zero-shot surgical segmentation, but its applicability in complex surgical environments, with challenges like tissue deformation and instrument variability, remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of the zero-shot capability of SAM2 in 9 surgical datasets (17 surgery types), covering laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic procedures. We analyze various prompting (points, boxes, mask) and {finetuning (dense, sparse) strategies}, robustness to surgical challenges, and generalization across procedures and anatomies. Key findings reveal that while SAM2 demonstrates notable zero-shot adaptability in structured scenarios (e.g., instrument segmentation, {multi-organ segmentation}, and scene segmentation), its performance varies under dynamic surgical conditions, highlighting gaps in handling temporal coherence and domain-specific artifacts. These results highlight future pathways to adaptive data-efficient solutions for the surgical data science field.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency.

Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation. However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations. We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 18 figures, 9 tables.

While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing systems are restricted to human timbres and have limited ability to synthesize voices outside the human range, which are increasingly demanded in creative applications such as video games, movies, and virtual characters. We introduce Non-Human Singing Generation (NHSG), covering non-human singing voice synthesis (NHSVS) and non-human singing voice conversion (NHSVC), as a novel machine learning task for generating musically coherent singing with non-human timbral characteristics. NHSG is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of non-human singing data, the lack of symbolic alignment, and the wide timbral gap between human and non-human voices. To address these challenges, we propose CartoonSing, a unified framework that integrates singing voice synthesis and conversion while bridging human and non-human singing generation. CartoonSing employs a two-stage pipeline: a score representation encoder trained with annotated human singing and a timbre-aware vocoder that reconstructs waveforms for both human and non-human audio. Experiments demonstrate that CartoonSing successfully generates non-human singing voices, generalizes to novel timbres, and extends conventional SVS and SVC toward creative, non-human singing generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STARFlow-V: End-to-End Video Generative Modeling with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20462v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

| **[Benchmarking the Trustworthiness in Multimodal LLMs for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12336v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video understanding (videoLLMs) have enhanced their capacity to process complex spatiotemporal data. However, challenges such as factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks compromise their reliability. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial, 18 open-source) across five critical dimensions: truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses spatiotemporal risks, temporal consistency and cross-modal impact. Results reveal significant limitations in dynamic scene comprehension, cross-modal perturbation resilience and real-world risk mitigation. While open-source models occasionally outperform, proprietary models generally exhibit superior credibility, though scaling does not consistently improve performance. These findings underscore the need for enhanced training datat diversity and robust multimodal alignment. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolkit for standardized trustworthiness assessments, addressing the critical gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

| **[TrafficLens: Multi-Camera Traffic Video Analysis Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20965v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE 27th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> | None |

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Video Translation via Token Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12099v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the revolution of generative AI, video-related tasks have been widely studied. However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video demonstrations can be found on our project webpage: https://alex-zhu1.github.io/TokenWarping/.

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).</p></details> | 19 pages | None |

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts  triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation. Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20649v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://infinity-rope.github.io/</p></details> | None |

We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://diverse-video.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively.

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Reason-then-Describe Instruction Interpreter for Controllable Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20563v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers have significantly improved video fidelity and temporal coherence, however, practical controllability remains limited. Concise, ambiguous, and compositionally complex user inputs contrast with the detailed prompts used in training, yielding an intent-output mismatch. We propose ReaDe, a universal, model-agnostic interpreter that converts raw instructions into precise, actionable specifications for downstream video generators. ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs.

| **[PhysChoreo: Physics-Controllable Video Generation with Part-Aware Semantic Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20562v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent video generation models have achieved significant visual fidelity, they often suffer from the lack of explicit physical controllability and plausibility. To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
