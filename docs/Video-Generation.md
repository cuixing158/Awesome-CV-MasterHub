| **[Video-R2: Reinforcing Consistent and Grounded Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23478v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video-R2 Technical Report</p></details> | None |
| **[AnyTalker: Scaling Multi-Person Talking Video Generation with Interactivity Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23475v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://hkust-c4g.github.io/AnyTalker-homepage</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hkust-c4g.github.io/AnyTalker-homepage) |
| **[Uncovering Zero-Shot Generalization Gaps in Time-Series Foundation Models Using Real-World Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on time-series foundation models (TSFMs) has underscored the scarcity of real-world data, often supplemented with synthetic sources in existing datasets, whose generalizability remains however debated. As such, in this work, we propose a novel benchmarking approach: in particular, we aim at building a curated dataset reflecting real world physical temporal dynamics, extracting temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow. As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets. These findings underscore the need for novel approaches to acquiring time series data and highlight the lack of universality in recent TSFMs, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) Workshop @ AAAI 2026: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</p></details> | None |

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project page:https://hunyuan-gamecraft-2.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[DisMo: Disentangled Motion Representations for Open-World Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23428v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

| **[Toward Automatic Safe Driving Instruction: A Large-Scale Vision Language Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23311v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MMLoSo 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Vision Bridge Transformer at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23199v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GeoWorld: Unlocking the Potential of Geometry Models to Facilitate High-Fidelity 3D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23191v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[Source-free Video Domain Adaptation by Learning from Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18572v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress seen in classification methods, current approaches for handling videos with distribution shifts in source and target domains remain source-dependent as they require access to the source data during the adaptation stage. In this paper, we present a self-training based source-free video domain adaptation approach to address this challenge by bridging the gap between the source and the target domains. We use the source pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain samples, which are inevitably noisy. Thus, we treat the problem of source-free video domain adaptation as learning from noisy labels and argue that the samples with correct pseudo-labels can help us in adaptation. To this end, we leverage the cross-entropy loss as an indicator of the correctness of the pseudo-labels and use the resulting small-loss samples from the target domain for fine-tuning the model. We further enhance the adaptation performance by implementing a teacher-student (TS) framework, in which the teacher, which is updated gradually, produces reliable pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, the student undergoes fine-tuning on the target domain videos using these generated pseudo-labels to improve its performance. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our methods, termed as CleanAdapt, CleanAdapt + TS, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming the existing approaches on various open datasets.

| **[Fast Multi-view Consistent 3D Editing with Video Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23172v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[InstanceV: Instance-Level Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23146v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DualCamCtrl: Dual-Branch Diffusion Model for Geometry-Aware Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23127v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

| **[LatBot: Distilling Universal Latent Actions for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23034v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning transferable latent actions from large-scale object manipulation videos can significantly enhance generalization in downstream robotics tasks, as such representations are agnostic to different robot embodiments. Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mm-robot.github.io/distill_latent_action/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://mm-robot.github.io/distill_latent_action) |
| **[Chiplet-Based RISC-V SoC with Modular AI Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18355v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 3rd IEEE International Conference of Computational Intelligence and Network Systems 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[McSc: Motion-Corrective Preference Alignment for Video Generation with Self-Critic Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22974v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.</p></details> |  | None |

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg) |

However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches.

However, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: 1) incomplete representation of video details, leading to weak alignment, and 2) inadequate temporal and rhythmic correspondence, particularly in achieving precise beat synchronization. To address the challenges, we propose Video Echoed in Music (VeM), a latent music diffusion that generates high-quality soundtracks with semantic, temporal, and rhythmic alignment for input videos. To capture video details comprehensively, VeM employs a hierarchical video parsing that acts as a music conductor, orchestrating multi-level information across modalities. Modality-specific encoders, coupled with a storyboard-guided cross-attention mechanism (SG-CAtt), integrate semantic cues while maintaining temporal coherence through position and duration encoding. For rhythmic precision, the frame-level transition-beat aligner and adapter (TB-As) dynamically synchronize visual scene transitions with music beats. We further contribute a novel video-music paired dataset sourced from e-commerce advertisements and video-sharing platforms, which imposes stricter transition-beat synchronization requirements. Meanwhile, we introduce novel metrics tailored to the task. Experimental results demonstrate superiority, particularly in semantic relevance and rhythmic precision.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks.

| **[TARFVAE: Efficient One-Step Generative Time Series Forecasting via TARFLOW based VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22853v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01730v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> | None |
| **[Captain Safari: A World Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22815v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Taming generative video models for zero-shot optical flow extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09082v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem. Motivated by the recent success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only to predict future frames can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior attempts to read out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning; that strategy is ill-suited for flow, where labeled data is scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models for zero-shot flow extraction. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recently introduced Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time inference procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method is competitive with state-of-the-art, task-specific models on the real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS benchmark and the synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric. Our results show that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is an effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss methods for high-quality flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://neuroailab.github.io/projects/kl_tracing</p></details> | [Code Link](https://neuroailab.github.io/projects) |

However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

Building on the recent success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench, outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Oral | None |
| **[Fast3Dcache: Training-free 3D Geometry Synthesis Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22533v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accelerating Parallel Diffusion Model Serving with Residual Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17511v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method. CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings, and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review CVPR 2026 (44 Pages)</p></details> | None |

Animating 3D Gaussian Scenes with Dynamic Weather Effects via Physics-Guided Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05296v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, dynamic editing of such scenes remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel framework, Physics-Guided Score Distillation, to address a fundamental conflict: physics simulation provides a strong motion prior that is insufficient for photorealism , while video-based Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) alone cannot generate coherent motion for complex, multi-particle scenarios. We resolve this through a unified optimization framework where physics simulation guides Score Distillation to jointly refine the motion prior for photorealism while simultaneously optimizing appearance. Specifically, we learn a neural dynamics model that predicts particle motion and appearance, optimized end-to-end via a combined loss integrating Video-SDS for photorealism with our physics-guidance prior. This allows for photorealistic refinements while ensuring the dynamics remain plausible. Our framework enables scene-wide dynamic weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, with physically plausible motion. Experiments demonstrate our physics-guided approach significantly outperforms baselines, with ablations confirming this joint refinement is essential for generating coherent, high-fidelity dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow) |

While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos.

While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques.

We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://match-and-fuse.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Existing datasets are narrow, static, and costly to annotate, while synthetic data often yields oversimplified or misaligned behaviors. We present Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts readily available Internet videos of human computer use into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating actions or relying on handcrafted heuristics, we cast trajectory annotation as an inverse dynamics problem that predicts user actions from consecutive screen states, which simplifies learning and generalizes across domains. Through a task-aware retrieval and labeling pipeline, W&L yields over 53K high-quality trajectories that enhance CUAs both as in-context exemplars and as supervised training data. On OSWorld, it consistently improves general-purpose and specialized CUAs, while on WindowsAgentArena it achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale models under the 15-step limit.

Existing VisualTTS models typically adopt lightweight architectures and design specialized modules to achieve the above goals respectively, yet the speech quality is not satisfied due to the model capacity and the limited data in VisualTTS. Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics.</p></details> | MM Asia 2025 | None |

To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a "general" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization. In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

Due to the varying granularity of target states across different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.</p></details> | 8 pages, with supp | None |

We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GA2-CLIP: Generic Attribute Anchor for Efficient Prompt Tuningin Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22125v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.</p></details> |  | None |

This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

To do this, video understanding models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel environments, tasks, and problem domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) video question answering, over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to: (1) generalize to novel domains; (2) utilize long temporal context and multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) information. Our extensive experimental analysis highlights the challenges of Spacewalk-18, but also suggests best practices for domain generalization and long-form understanding. Notably, we discover a promising adaptation via summarization technique that leads to significant performance improvement without model fine-tuning. The Spacewalk-18 benchmark is released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18/.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | [Code Link](https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18) |

Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting with Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16952v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification. Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoGAN: Improving Motion Quality in Video Diffusion via Few-Step Motion Adversarial Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21592v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

| **[Harmony: Harmonizing Audio and Video Generation through Cross-Task Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21579v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  | None |

While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version (NeurIPS 2025).

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding.

However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

The SAM2 model, pretrained on natural videos, offers potential for zero-shot surgical segmentation, but its applicability in complex surgical environments, with challenges like tissue deformation and instrument variability, remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of the zero-shot capability of SAM2 in 9 surgical datasets (17 surgery types), covering laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic procedures. We analyze various prompting (points, boxes, mask) and {finetuning (dense, sparse) strategies}, robustness to surgical challenges, and generalization across procedures and anatomies. Key findings reveal that while SAM2 demonstrates notable zero-shot adaptability in structured scenarios (e.g., instrument segmentation, {multi-organ segmentation}, and scene segmentation), its performance varies under dynamic surgical conditions, highlighting gaps in handling temporal coherence and domain-specific artifacts. These results highlight future pathways to adaptive data-efficient solutions for the surgical data science field.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.</p></details> |  | None |

The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

| **[CtrlVDiff: Controllable Video Generation via Unified Multimodal Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21129v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation. However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations. We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 18 figures, 9 tables.

While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CartoonSing: Unifying Human and Nonhuman Timbres in Singing Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21045v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singing voice synthesis (SVS) and singing voice conversion (SVC) have achieved remarkable progress in generating natural-sounding human singing. However, existing systems are restricted to human timbres and have limited ability to synthesize voices outside the human range, which are increasingly demanded in creative applications such as video games, movies, and virtual characters. We introduce Non-Human Singing Generation (NHSG), covering non-human singing voice synthesis (NHSVS) and non-human singing voice conversion (NHSVC), as a novel machine learning task for generating musically coherent singing with non-human timbral characteristics. NHSG is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of non-human singing data, the lack of symbolic alignment, and the wide timbral gap between human and non-human voices. To address these challenges, we propose CartoonSing, a unified framework that integrates singing voice synthesis and conversion while bridging human and non-human singing generation. CartoonSing employs a two-stage pipeline: a score representation encoder trained with annotated human singing and a timbre-aware vocoder that reconstructs waveforms for both human and non-human audio. Experiments demonstrate that CartoonSing successfully generates non-human singing voices, generalizes to novel timbres, and extends conventional SVS and SVC toward creative, non-human singing generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STARFlow-V: End-to-End Video Generative Modeling with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20462v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

| **[Benchmarking the Trustworthiness in Multimodal LLMs for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12336v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video understanding (videoLLMs) have enhanced their capacity to process complex spatiotemporal data. However, challenges such as factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks compromise their reliability. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial, 18 open-source) across five critical dimensions: truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses spatiotemporal risks, temporal consistency and cross-modal impact. Results reveal significant limitations in dynamic scene comprehension, cross-modal perturbation resilience and real-world risk mitigation. While open-source models occasionally outperform, proprietary models generally exhibit superior credibility, though scaling does not consistently improve performance. These findings underscore the need for enhanced training datat diversity and robust multimodal alignment. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolkit for standardized trustworthiness assessments, addressing the critical gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE 27th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Video Translation via Token Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12099v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the revolution of generative AI, video-related tasks have been widely studied. However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce TokenWarping, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, TokenWarping leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that TokenWarping surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video demonstrations can be found on our project webpage: https://alex-zhu1.github.io/TokenWarping/.

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).</p></details> | 19 pages | None |

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending.

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts  triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation. Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://infinity-rope.github.io/</p></details> | None |

We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://diverse-video.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control.

However, current methods still face challenges, including the lack of intricate details, overly smoothed surfaces, and fragmented thin-shell structures. These limitations leave the generated 3D assets still one step short of meeting the standards favored by artists. In this paper, we present ShapeGen, which achieves high-quality image-to-3D shape generation through 3D representation and supervision improvements, resolution scaling up, and the advantages of linear transformers. These advancements allow the generated assets to be seamlessly integrated into 3D pipelines, facilitating their widespread adoption across various applications. Through extensive experiments, we validate the impact of these improvements on overall performance. Ultimately, thanks to the synergistic effects of these enhancements, ShapeGen achieves a significant leap in image-to-3D generation, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLMs, Diffusions, and the Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Concise, ambiguous, and compositionally complex user inputs contrast with the detailed prompts used in training, yielding an intent-output mismatch. We propose ReaDe, a universal, model-agnostic interpreter that converts raw instructions into precise, actionable specifications for downstream video generators. ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs. ReaDe offers a practical route to aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent.

To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.</p></details> | 26 pages, 17 figures | None |

However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

| **[IVY-FAKE: A Unified Explainable Framework and Benchmark for Image and Video AIGC Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00979v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) techniques has enabled the creation of high-quality synthetic content, but it also raises significant security concerns. Current detection methods face two major limitations: (1) the lack of multidimensional explainable datasets for generated images and videos. Existing open-source datasets (e.g., WildFake, GenVideo) rely on oversimplified binary annotations, which restrict the explainability and trustworthiness of trained detectors. (2) Prior MLLM-based forgery detectors (e.g., FakeVLM) exhibit insufficiently fine-grained interpretability in their step-by-step reasoning, which hinders reliable localization and explanation. To address these challenges, we introduce Ivy-Fake, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark for explainable AIGC detection. It consists of over 106K richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 5,000 manually verified evaluation examples, sourced from multiple generative models and real world datasets through a carefully designed pipeline to ensure both diversity and quality. Furthermore, we propose Ivy-xDetector, a reinforcement learning model based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), capable of producing explainable reasoning chains and achieving robust performance across multiple synthetic content detection benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our dataset and confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our method improves performance on GenImage from 86.88% to 96.32%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |
| **[Block Cascading: Training Free Acceleration of Block-Causal Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20426v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures | None |

To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures | None |

They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |

This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models.

This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing ROI-based video encryption methods suffer from insufficient flexibility and lack of a unified evaluation system. To address these issues, we propose a visual perception-based tunable framework and evaluation benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI encryption. Our scheme introduces three key contributions: 1) A ROI region recognition module based on visual perception network is proposed to accurately identify the ROI region in videos. 2) A three-level tunable encryption strategy is implemented while balancing security and real-time performance. 3) A unified ROI encryption evaluation benchmark is developed to provide a standardized quantitative platform for subsequent research. This triple strategy provides new solution and significant unified performance evaluation methods for ROI selective encryption field. Experimental results indicate that the proposed benchmark can comprehensively measure the performance of the ROI selective encryption. Compared to existing ROI encryption algorithms, our proposed enhanced and advanced level encryption exhibit superior performance in multiple performance metrics. In general, the proposed framework effectively meets the privacy protection requirements in H.265/HEVC and provides a reliable solution for secure and efficient processing of sensitive video content.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models.

Existing methods often rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation. Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping. Thanks to these designs, which greatly preserve the pre-trained prior of the video generation model, our approach is able to outperform other full-parameter training methods in video quality and identity preservation, even with just $\sim$1% additional parameters and only 2000 training pairs. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks, such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation, stylization, and face swapping.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thu-ml.github.io/UltraViCo.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://thu-ml.github.io/UltraViCo.github.io) |

To bridge this gap, we introduce A2Seek (Aerial Anomaly Seek), a large-scale, reasoning-centric benchmark dataset for aerial anomaly understanding. This dataset covers various scenarios and environmental conditions, providing high-resolution real-world aerial videos with detailed annotations, including anomaly categories, frame-level timestamps, region-level bounding boxes, and natural language explanations for causal reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose A2Seek-R1, a novel reasoning framework that generalizes R1-style strategies to aerial anomaly understanding, enabling a deeper understanding of "Where" anomalies occur and "Why" they happen in aerial frames. To this end, A2Seek-R1 first employs a graph-of-thought (GoT)-guided supervised fine-tuning approach to activate the model's latent reasoning capabilities on A2Seek. Then, we introduce Aerial Group Relative Policy Optimization (A-GRPO) to design rule-based reward functions tailored to aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a novel "seeking" mechanism that simulates UAV flight behavior by directing the model's attention to informative regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2Seek-R1 achieves up to a 22.04% improvement in AP for prediction accuracy and a 13.9% gain in mIoU for anomaly localization, exhibiting strong generalization across complex environments and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few pre-defined conditioning settings. To tackle these constraints, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. Our method can also generalize to both UNet-based and transformer-based architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 26 pages</p></details> | None |

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to accurately understand driving scenes and generate trustworthy trajectories. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT integrates a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, which is trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a k-means & HNSW retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Retrieved prior knowledge is added into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning paradigm aligns the VLM backbone to enhance spatial perception and trajectory prediction capabilities. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves the best open-loop performance compared with baseline methods. Ablation studies on fine-tuning stages, Top-K value of RAG, different retrieval strategies, vision encoders, and VLM backbones are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of KEPT. These results indicate that KEPT offers a promising, data-efficient way toward trustworthy trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework introduces choreography patterns -- structured sequences of motion beats that define the long-range structure of a dance -- as a novel high-level control signal for dance video generation. These patterns can be automatically estimated from human dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes representing distinct animal poses, generated via text-to-image prompting or GPT-4o, we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem that seeks the optimal keyframe structure to satisfy a specified choreography pattern of beats. We also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up to 30 seconds dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://how-animals-dance.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Motion Marionette: Rethinking Rigid Motion Transfer via Prior Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19909v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.

To address this, the 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduced key uplink enhancements, including Uplink Multi-Input Multi-Output (UL-MIMO) and Uplink 256QAM, to improve throughput and spectral efficiency. However, while the benefits of these features for raw data rates are well-documented, their practical impact on real-time applications like live-streaming is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). To ensure a fair assessment, we conduct a comparative analysis by modifying the modem firmware of commercial User Equipment (UE), allowing these features to be selectively enabled and disabled on the same device. Performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including dropped video frames and connection stability. Furthermore, this study analyzes 5G Radio Frequency (RF) parameters to quantify the spectral efficiency impact, specifically examining metrics derived from the Channel State Information (CSI) framework, including Reference Signal Received Power (CSI-RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ), and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CSI-SINR).</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP 2025), 1-4 December 2025, Klagenfurt, Austria</p></details> | None |

Though reinforcement learning from human feedback offers promise for preference alignment, existing reward models for visual generation face limitations, including black-box scoring without interpretability and potentially resultant unexpected biases. We present VisionReward, a general framework for learning human visual preferences in both image and video generation. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical visual assessment framework to capture fine-grained human preferences, and leverages linear weighting to enable interpretable preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation. Notably, VisionReward surpasses VideoScore by 17.2% in preference prediction accuracy, and text-to-video models with VisionReward achieve a 31.6% higher pairwise win rate compared to the same models using VideoScore.

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions.

Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.</p></details> | preprint | None |

However, these approaches often fall short in modeling complex narratives and maintaining character consistency over extended periods, which is essential for long-form video production like movies. We propose MovieDreamer, a novel hierarchical framework that integrates the strengths of autoregressive models with diffusion-based rendering to pioneer long-duration video generation with intricate plot progressions and high visual fidelity. Our approach utilizes autoregressive models for global narrative coherence, predicting sequences of visual tokens that are subsequently transformed into high-quality video frames through diffusion rendering. This method is akin to traditional movie production processes, where complex stories are factorized down into manageable scene capturing. Further, we employ a multimodal script that enriches scene descriptions with detailed character information and visual style, enhancing continuity and character identity across scenes. We present extensive experiments across various movie genres, demonstrating that our approach not only achieves superior visual and narrative quality but also effectively extends the duration of generated content significantly beyond current capabilities.

Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn) |

For example, OCR errors like misreading "50 mph" as "60 mph" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations. Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps.

A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari.</p></details> |  | None |

Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.</p></details> | 13pages,6figures | None |
| **[One Attention, One Scale: Phase-Aligned Rotary Positional Embeddings for Mixed-Resolution Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19778v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify a core failure mode that occurs when using the usual linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers. When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse. To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft) |

However, prior work does not permit visual illustration of multistep descriptions, e.g. a cooking recipe or a gardening instruction manual, and simply handling each step description in isolation would result in an incoherent demonstration. We propose Stitch-a-Demo, a novel retrieval-based method to assemble a video demonstration from a multistep description. The resulting video contains clips, possibly from different sources, that accurately reflect all the step descriptions, while being visually coherent. We formulate a training pipeline that creates large-scale weakly supervised data containing diverse procedures and injects hard negatives that promote both correctness and coherence. Validated on in-the-wild instructional videos, Stitch-a-Demo achieves state-of-the-art performance, with gains up to 29% as well as dramatic wins in a human preference study.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models - generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions - are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency - capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce an evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks - action recognition and character recognition - each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a VLM-based evaluator for video world model rollouts adapted under data and compute constraints. In our extensive experiments totaling over 5,154 GPU-days, we explore full, partial, and parameter-efficient adaptation methods across various task formats, context lengths, sampling methods, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator achieves parity with task-specific checkpoints. Human studies across seven diverse environments confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a lightweight, adaptable, and semantics-aware evaluator for video world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS LAW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |
| **[Vidi2: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19529v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video has emerged as the primary medium for communication and creativity on the Internet, driving strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Vision--Language Models (VLMs) struggle with generalization across heterogeneous platforms and lack precision in interface understanding and action execution. We introduce Yanyun-3, a VLM-based agent that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for visual reasoning and UI-TARS for interface execution. We propose a novel data organization principle -- combination granularity -- to distinguish intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing of multimodal data (static images, multi-image sequences, and videos). The model is fine-tuned using QLoRA on a curated dataset across three strategy game platforms. The optimal strategy (M*V+S) achieves a 12.98x improvement in BLEU-4 score and a 63% reduction in inference time compared to full fusion. Yanyun-3 successfully executes core tasks (e.g., target selection, resource allocation) across platforms without platform-specific tuning. Our findings demonstrate that structured multimodal data organization significantly enhances VLM performance in embodied tasks. Yanyun-3 offers a generalizable framework for GUI automation, with broader implications for robotics and autonomous systems.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures | None |

To address this limitation, we propose FaVChat, a Video-MLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial understanding. FaVChat introduces a multi-level prompt-guided feature extraction mechanism that progressively captures task-relevant information from three complementary stages: low-level transformer layers for textures and motion, medium-level learnable queries for discriminative regions, and high-level adaptive feature weighting for semantic alignment. These enriched features are dynamically fused and fed into the LLM to enable more accurate fine-grained reasoning. To further enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained facial attributes and maximize the utility of limited data, we propose Date-Efficient GRPO, a novel data-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that maximizes the utility of each training sample through per-instance utility estimation and dynamic lifecycle scheduling. Extensive zero-shot evaluations across emotion recognition, explainable reasoning, and textual expression analysis demonstrate that FaVChat achieves finer-grained understanding, stronger accuracy, and better generalization than existing Video-MLLMs, even when trained with only 10K RL samples.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VideoChat-M1: Collaborative Policy Planning for Video Understanding via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19524v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By leveraging tool-augmented Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), multi-agent frameworks are driving progress in video understanding. However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably, on LongVideoBench, our method outperforms the SOTA model Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |

Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency.

The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report | None |

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO.</p></details> |  | None |

The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, with supp | None |

Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://droliven.github.io/SyncMV4D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://droliven.github.io/SyncMV4D) |

Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region. On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/FOCUS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/FOCUS) |

This survey categorises six primary generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends, and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques and unresolved challenges. Building on a common taxonomy of models and training recipes, we propose a unified evaluation framework centred on faithfulness, compositionality, and robustness, and synthesise evidence from benchmarks and human studies across modalities. We further analyse trustworthiness, safety, and ethical risks, including multimodal bias, privacy leakage, and the misuse of high-fidelity media generation for deepfakes, disinformation, and copyright infringement in music and 3D assets, together with emerging mitigation strategies. Finally, we discuss how architectural trends, evaluation protocols, and governance mechanisms can be co-designed to close current capability and safety gaps, outlining critical paths toward more general-purpose, controllable, and accountable multimodal generative systems.</p></details> |  | None |

But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications. Code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time.

| **[AvatarBrush: Monocular Reconstruction of Gaussian Avatars with Intuitive Local Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19189v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient reconstruction of high-quality and intuitively editable human avatars presents a pressing challenge in the field of computer vision. Recent advancements, such as 3DGS, have demonstrated impressive reconstruction efficiency and rapid rendering speeds. However, intuitive local editing of these representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose AvatarBrush, a framework that reconstructs fully animatable and locally editable avatars using only a monocular video input. We propose a three-layer model to represent the avatar and, inspired by mesh morphing techniques, design a framework to generate the Gaussian model from local information of the parametric body model. Compared to previous methods that require scanned meshes or multi-view captures as input, our approach reduces costs and enhances editing capabilities such as body shape adjustment, local texture modification, and geometry transfer. Our experimental results demonstrate superior quality across two datasets and emphasize the enhanced, user-friendly, and localized editing capabilities of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Oral, Industry Track)</p></details> | None |

Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

| **[Beyond Reward Margin: Rethinking and Resolving Likelihood Displacement in Diffusion Models via Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19049v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[View-Consistent Diffusion Representations for 3D-Consistent Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18991v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages | None |
| **[Eevee: Towards Close-up High-resolution Video-based Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18957v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on technology provides a cost-effective solution for creating marketing videos in fashion e-commerce. However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.</p></details> |  | None |

By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models.

Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MagicWorld: Interactive Geometry-driven Video World Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18886v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Typically, decoupling the appearance and motion training, prior methods often introduce concept interference, resulting in inaccurate rendering of appearance features or motion patterns. In addition, these methods often suffer from appearance contamination, in which background and foreground elements from reference videos distort the customized video. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by proposing JointTuner. The core motivation of our JointTuner is to enable joint optimization of both appearance and motion components, upon which two key innovations are developed, i.e., Gated Low-Rank Adaptation (GLoRA) and Appearance-independent Temporal Loss (AiT Loss). Specifically, GLoRA uses a context-aware activation layer, analogous to a gating regulator, to dynamically steer LoRA modules toward learning either appearance or motion while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Moreover, with the finding that channel-temporal shift noise suppresses appearance-related low-frequencies while enhancing motion-related high-frequencies, we designed the AiT Loss. This loss adds the same shift to the diffusion model's predicted noise during fine-tuning, forcing the model to prioritize learning motion patterns. JointTuner's architecture-agnostic design supports both UNet (e.g., ZeroScope) and Diffusion Transformer (e.g., CogVideoX) backbones, ensuring its customization capabilities scale with the evolution of foundational video models. Furthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework for appearance-motion combined customization, covering 90 combinations evaluated along four critical dimensions: semantic alignment, motion dynamism, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality.

However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion.

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI.

VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks.

The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution.

While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Seeing What Matters: Visual Preference Policy Optimization for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18719v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Modality-Collaborative Low-Rank Decomposers for Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18711v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Moreover, most struggle to address biased user behaviors (e.g., accidental clicks, fast skips), leading to inaccurate interest modeling and frequent negative feedback in top recommendations with unclear causes. To tackle this issue, we collect real-world user video-watching sequences, annotate the reasons for users' dislikes, and construct a benchmark dataset for personalized explanations. We then introduce the Agentic Explainable Negative Feedback (ENF) framework, which integrates three core components: (1) the Profile Agent, extracting behavioral cues from users' historical data to derive psychological and personality profiles; (2) the Video Agent, performing comprehensive multimodal video analysis; and (3) the Reason Agent, synthesizing information from the other two agents to predict user engagement and generate explanations. Additionally, we propose the S-GRPO algorithm, enabling the model to progressively address complex tasks during reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in negative feedback prediction and reason explanation. Notably, it achieves an 8.6% improvement over GPT-4o in reason classification. Deployment on the business platform further validates its benefits: increasing average user watch time by 6.2%, reducing the fast-skip rate by 9.4%, and significantly enhancing user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

| **[Evaluation of NVENC Split-Frame Encoding (SFE) for UHD Video Transcoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18687v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) features in modern NVIDIA GPUs, offer significant advantages over software encoders by providing comparable Rate-Distortion (RD) performance while consuming considerably less power. The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS 2025), 8-11 December 2025, Aachen, Germany</p></details> | None |

Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 33rd International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2024), 29-31 July 2024, Big Island, Hawaii, USA</p></details> | None |

Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16669v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages,10 Figures, Project Website: https://idealistxy.github.io/Uni-MoE-v2.github.io/ Codes: https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE) |

Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints. In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation. Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges remain in developing systems that respond quickly to user intent, produce stable flicker-free output suitable for device control, and work across different subjects without time-consuming calibration. In this work, we propose a framework for EMG-based intent detection that addresses these challenges. We cast intent detection as per-timestep segmentation of continuous sEMG streams, assigning labels as gestures unfold in real time. We introduce a masked modeling training strategy that aligns muscle activations with their corresponding user intents, enabling rapid onset detection and stable tracking of ongoing gestures. In evaluations against baseline methods, using metrics that capture accuracy, latency and stability for device control, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditions. These results demonstrate its potential for wearable robotics and next-generation prosthetic systems.

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | None |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can expand knowledge dynamically, yet existing video RAG schemes adopt fixed retrieval paradigms that ignore query difficulty. This uniform design causes redundant computation and latency for simple queries, while coarse retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning can miss key information. Such single-step retrieval severely limits the trade-off between efficiency and cognitive depth. We propose AdaVideoRAG, an adaptive RAG framework for long-video understanding. A lightweight intent classifier dynamically selects suitable retrieval schemes according to query complexity from the simplest to the most sophisticated. We design an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module that extracts and organizes multi-modal information into three databases: (1) a text base built from clip captions, ASR, and OCR; (2) a visual base; and (3) a knowledge graph for deep semantic understanding. This supports hierarchical knowledge access, from naive retrieval to graph-based retrieval, balancing resource cost and reasoning ability. To evaluate deep understanding, we further construct the HiVU benchmark. Experiments show that AdaVideoRAG significantly improves both efficiency and accuracy on long-video QA tasks and can be seamlessly plugged into existing MLLMs through lightweight APIs, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval-augmented video analysis.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

In existing works, users often interact with VideoLLMs by using the entire video and a query as input, after which the model generates a response. This interaction format constrains the application of VideoLLMs in scenarios such as live-streaming comprehension where videos do not end and responses are required in a real-time manner, and also results in unsatisfactory performance on time-sensitive tasks that requires localizing video segments. In this paper, we focus on a video-text duet interaction format. This interaction format is characterized by the continuous playback of the video, and both the user and the model can insert their text messages at any position during the video playback. When a text message ends, the video continues to play, akin to the alternative of two performers in a duet. We construct MMDuetIT, a video-text training dataset designed to adapt VideoLLMs to video-text duet interaction format. We also introduce the Multi-Answer Grounded Video Question Answering (MAGQA) task to benchmark the real-time response ability of VideoLLMs. Trained on MMDuetIT, MMDuet demonstrates that adopting the video-text duet interaction format enables the model to achieve significant improvements in various time-sensitive tasks (76% CIDEr on YouCook2 dense video captioning, 90\% mAP on QVHighlights highlight detection and 25% R@0.5 on Charades-STA temporal video grounding) with minimal training efforts, and also enable VideoLLMs to reply in a real-time manner as the video plays.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension.

| **[Alias-free 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18367v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting enable real-time rendering and generate realistic images. However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free) |
| **[TRANSPORTER: Transferring Visual Semantics from VLM Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18359v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://alexandrosstergiou.github.io/TRANSPORTER</p></details> | [Code Link](https://alexandrosstergiou.github.io/TRANSPORTER) |
| **[MagicWand: A Universal Agent for Generation and Evaluation Aligned with User Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18352v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) models have enabled significant progress in image and video generation. However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlowPortal: Residual-Corrected Flow for Training-Free Video Relighting and Background Replacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18346v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video relighting with background replacement is a challenging task critical for applications in film production and creative media. Existing methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness. To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation. Additionally, a masking strategy isolates foreground relighting from background pure generation process. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPortal achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism, while maintaining high efficiency.
