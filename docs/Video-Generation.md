| **[Sekai: A Video Dataset towards World Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15675v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.

| **[Show-o2: Improved Native Unified Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15564v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,} Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a 3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model, autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate versatility in handling a wide range of multimodal understanding and generation tasks across diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Code and models are released at https://github.com/showlab/Show-o.</p></details> | Technical report | [Code Link](https://github.com/showlab/Show-o) |
| **[VideoMAR: Autoregressive Video Generatio with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14168v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SurgSora: Object-Aware Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

| **[DreamGen: Unlocking Generalization in Robot Learning through Video World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12705v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.

| **[Causally Steered Diffusion for Automated Video Counterfactual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14404v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models for video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships in video content. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes risk generating unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we propose a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, guided by a vision-language model (VLM). Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering. With its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our method holds significant potential for generating realistic "what-if" video scenarios in diverse areas such as healthcare and digital media.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CausalDiffTab: Mixed-Type Causal-Aware Diffusion for Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14206v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data has been proven to be one of the most critical components in training generative AI. However, obtaining high-quality data remains challenging, with data privacy issues presenting a significant hurdle. To address the need for high-quality data. Synthesize data has emerged as a mainstream solution, demonstrating impressive performance in areas such as images, audio, and video. Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven datasets demonstrate that CausalDiffTab outperforms baseline methods across all metrics. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Godz-z/CausalDiffTab.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Godz-z/CausalDiffTab) |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Static Quantization Method for Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15077v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers for video generation have gained significant research interest since the impressive performance of SORA. Efficient deployment of such generative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization. However, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and need static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI processors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training quantization of OpenSora\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without relying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static quantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically quantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular, we utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training statically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise quantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By further applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality video outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to dynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more efficient approach without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[UltraVideo: High-Quality UHD Video Dataset with Comprehensive Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13691v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of the video dataset (image quality, resolution, and fine-grained caption) greatly influences the performance of the video generation model. The growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However, the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications. In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation. UltraVideo dataset and UltraWan models are available at https://xzc-zju.github.io/projects/UltraVideo.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://xzc-zju.github.io/projects) |
| **[RIFLEx: A Free Lunch for Length Extrapolation in Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15894v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2x extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3x extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos.

| **[T-SVG: Text-Driven Stereoscopic Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09323v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of stereoscopic videos has opened new horizons in multimedia, particularly in extended reality (XR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, where immersive content captivates audiences across various platforms. Despite its growing popularity, producing stereoscopic videos remains challenging due to the technical complexities involved in generating stereo parallax. This refers to the positional differences of objects viewed from two distinct perspectives and is crucial for creating depth perception. This complex process poses significant challenges for creators aiming to deliver convincing and engaging presentations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-driven Stereoscopic Video Generation (T-SVG) system. This innovative, model-agnostic, zero-shot approach streamlines video generation by using text prompts to create reference videos. These videos are transformed into 3D point cloud sequences, which are rendered from two perspectives with subtle parallax differences, achieving a natural stereoscopic effect. T-SVG represents a significant advancement in stereoscopic content creation by integrating state-of-the-art, training-free techniques in text-to-video generation, depth estimation, and video inpainting. Its flexible architecture ensures high efficiency and user-friendliness, allowing seamless updates with newer models without retraining. By simplifying the production pipeline, T-SVG makes stereoscopic video generation accessible to a broader audience, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the field.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |

In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

| **[STAGE: A Stream-Centric Generative World Model for Long-Horizon Driving-Scene Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13138v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iDiT-HOI: Inpainting-based Hand Object Interaction Reenactment via Video Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12847v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges. Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT) model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless hand-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 12 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[Video Depth Anything: Consistent Depth Estimation for Super-Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12375v3)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videodepthanything.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[SignAligner: Harmonizing Complementary Pose Modalities for Coherent Sign Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11621v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations: Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder, based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated sign videos.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Self-supervised Motion Representation for Portrait Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10096v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generative models, Motion representations based on human priors may introduce unrealistic motion, while methods relying on pre-trained generative models often suffer from inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Masked Motion Encoder, which leverages a self-supervised learning paradigm to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, we efficiently generate motion sequences based on the driving audio signal. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the motion decoder in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frame to target video. Thanks to the compact and expressive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method achieves efficient motion representation and high-quality video generation. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential.</p></details> |  | None |

Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error. The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise. Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their robust generative capabilities, these models often struggle with inversion inaccuracies, which could further limit their effectiveness in downstream tasks such as image and video editing. To address this issue, we propose RF-Solver, a novel training-free sampler that effectively enhances inversion precision by mitigating the errors in the ODE-solving process of rectified flow. Specifically, we derive the exact formulation of the rectified flow ODE and apply the high-order Taylor expansion to estimate its nonlinear components, significantly enhancing the precision of ODE solutions at each timestep. Building upon RF-Solver, we further propose RF-Edit, a general feature-sharing-based framework for image and video editing. By incorporating self-attention features from the inversion process into the editing process, RF-Edit effectively preserves the structural information of the source image or video while achieving high-quality editing results. Our approach is compatible with any pre-trained rectified-flow-based models for image and video tasks, requiring no additional training or optimization. Extensive experiments across generation, inversion, and editing tasks in both image and video modalities demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method.

Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g., text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility.

However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project) |
| **[A Unit Enhancement and Guidance Framework for Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose Parts-aware Audio-driven Human Animation, PAHA, a unit enhancement and guidance framework for audio-driven upper-body animation. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | revised | None |

Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision. Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources, GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17 evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data, GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  | None |

While most research focuses on real vs. fake detection, attributing a deep-fake to its specific generation model or encoder is vital for forensic analysis, enabling source tracing and tailored countermeasures. This enhances detection by leveraging model-specific artifacts and supports proactive defenses. We investigate the model attribution problem for deep-fake videos using two datasets: Deepfakes from Different Models (DFDM) and GANGen-Detection, both comprising deep-fake videos and GAN-generated images. We use only fake images from GANGen-Detection to align with DFDM's focus on attribution rather than binary classification. We formulate the task as a multiclass classification problem and introduce a novel Capsule-Spatial-Temporal (CapST) model that integrates a truncated VGG19 network for feature extraction, capsule networks for hierarchical encoding, and a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Video-level fusion captures temporal dependencies across frames. Experiments on DFDM and GANGen-Detection show CapST outperforms baseline models in attribution accuracy while reducing computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

However, expressive and realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose \textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped. Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a 3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on generation quality.

Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://playerone-hku.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> | None |

Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks.

These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity.

However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured.

It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines.

| **[Audio-Sync Video Generation with Multi-Stream Temporal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08003v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world, making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives (e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation. MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks, enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood, respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment.

| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model, and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new domains.

| **[Video Unlearning via Low-Rank Refusal Vector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07891v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe" and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity, graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks.

In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift. Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Consistent Video Editing as Flow-Driven Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07713v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures | None |

To address this, we present LetsTalk, a LinEar diffusion TranSformer for Talking video synthesis. LetsTalk incorporates a deep compression autoencoder to obtain efficient latent representations, and a spatio-temporal-aware transformer with efficient linear attention to effectively fuse multimodal information and enhance spatio-temporal consistency. We systematically explore and summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion. We thoroughly analyze their characteristics, applicability, and trade-offs, thereby bridging critical gaps in multimodal conditional guidance. Based on modality differences of image, audio, and video generation, we adopt deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait to ensure consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to align animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. To maintain temporal consistency in long-duration video generation, we propose a memory bank mechanism that preserves inter-clip dependencies, effectively preventing degradation across extended sequences. Furthermore, we develop a noise-regularized training strategy that explicitly compensates for DDPM sampling artifacts, significantly improving the model's robustness in continuous generation scenarios.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency through its optimized model design with 8$\times$ fewer parameters.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures | None |

Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

As part of these advancements, there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution, and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition, we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both object addition and non-rigid video editing.

In this work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping, without any training, compatible with any video models.

This shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task. Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders, we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$ higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability, providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent representation and generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-based Selection of Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13287v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results.

However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K.

While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K $256^2$ and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 $17 \times 256^2$.

These approaches typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both stereo video generation and restoration.

However, their substantial computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges. Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions, which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking, listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent capacity.

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations, including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only 23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior effectiveness and scalability.

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |

Although both quantization and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fps.ziplab.co</p></details> | None |

By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance, enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quality and versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://follow-your-creation.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent foreground, clean background, and blended scene. It also supports versatile variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus generating smooth videos with desired layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/LayerFlow-Page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sihuiji.github.io/LayerFlow-Page) |
| **[UNIC: Unified In-Context Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04216v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations (e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens, the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless, direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is at \href{https://zixuan-ye.github.io/UNIC}{https://zixuan-ye.github.io/UNIC}</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zixuan-ye.github.io/UNIC) |

Recently, In-context Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2 leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention. Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3 times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

However, optimizing these models remains challenging due to historically isolated paths of model-centric and data-centric developments, leading to suboptimal outcomes and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present a new sandbox suite tailored for integrated data-model co-development. This sandbox provides a feedback-driven experimental platform, enabling cost-effective iteration and guided refinement of both data and models. Our proposed ``Probe-Analyze-Refine'' workflow, validated through practical use cases on multimodal tasks such as image-text pre-training with CLIP, image-to-text generation with LLaVA-like models, and text-to-video generation with DiT-based models, yields transferable and notable performance boosts, such as topping the VBench leaderboard. A comprehensive set of over 100 experiments demonstrated the suite's usability and extensibility, while also uncovering insights into the interplay between data quality, diversity, model behavior, and computational costs.

To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/DenseDPO/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://snap-research.github.io/DenseDPO) |

Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Chipmunk: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers with Dynamic Column-Sparse Deltas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03275v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |

In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

To produce engaging animations, it is essential to generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene, characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot. Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project released at: https://qiulu66.github.io/animeshooter/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://qiulu66.github.io/animeshooter) |

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

Recently, action-driven generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts. However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and precise controllability.

Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59.

In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> | [Code Link](https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker) |
| **[LumosFlow: Motion-Guided Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02497v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances, synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However, both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion, resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and physics-based motion models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster) |

Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current models often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future, which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips (high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos. In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$ for the video task of generating 110+ frames.

However, existing datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68 anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g., falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA, revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios.

However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/shim0114/T2V-Diffusion-Search</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/shim0114/T2V-Diffusion-Search) |

However, existing interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality. Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in geometry-aware dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |

Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples.

Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications.

First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation.

| **[Evaluating Robot Policies in a World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions, WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos, while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging. Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane, enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality. We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality.

| **[MTVCrafter: 4D Motion Tokenization for Open-World Human Image Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10238v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios.

Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | Under review | None |

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video editing, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and visual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in slow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a novel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation that text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the pretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention layers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the first stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos produced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax optimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed. Specifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise ("bad noise") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains the model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging conditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object removal results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MiniMax-Remover compared to existing methods.

To achieve this, we re-formulate the animation task as two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting and Pose-aware Video Inpainting. The first step leverages a pre-trained image inpainting model to generate multi-view scene images from the reference art and optimizes a stable large-scale Gaussian field, which enables coarse background video rendering with camera trajectories. However, the rendered video is rough and only conveys scene motion. To resolve this, the second step trains a pose-aware video inpainting model that injects the dynamic character into the scene video while enhancing background quality. Specifically, this model is a DiT-based video generation model with a gating strategy that adaptively integrates the character's appearance and pose information into the base background video. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DreamDance, producing high-quality and consistent character animations with remarkable camera dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing works focus on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that, through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to generalize to dynamic video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sunyangtian.github.io/UniGeo-web/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://sunyangtian.github.io/UniGeo-web) |

However, enabling Interactive Video Generation (IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Because high-quality generations with DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the NFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However, many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation. Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA.

However, previous methods either rely solely on pixel-based VDMs, which come with high computational costs, or on latent-based VDMs, which often struggle with precise text-video alignment. In this paper, we are the first to propose a hybrid model, dubbed as Show-1, which marries pixel-based and latent-based VDMs for text-to-video generation. Our model first uses pixel-based VDMs to produce a low-resolution video of strong text-video correlation. After that, we propose a novel expert translation method that employs the latent-based VDMs to further upsample the low-resolution video to high resolution, which can also remove potential artifacts and corruptions from low-resolution videos. Compared to latent VDMs, Show-1 can produce high-quality videos of precise text-video alignment; Compared to pixel VDMs, Show-1 is much more efficient (GPU memory usage during inference is 15G vs 72G). Furthermore, our Show-1 model can be readily adapted for motion customization and video stylization applications through simple temporal attention layer finetuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark.

However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt, demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit video generation.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main | None |

However, current T2V models often struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge, VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method, CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive physics.

Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks inadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing spatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and 109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR), Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models.

Video Generative Models are Experts on Controllable Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23325v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models, including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation, show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images. These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified generative models across visual modalities.

However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging DIFF-ALL scenario.

Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However, intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative model for vidEo RestOration.

| **[MMGT: Motion Mask Guided Two-Stage Network for Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23120v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance, and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods. This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality, lip-sync, and gesture.

Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dair/geoman</p></details> | None |

Most models struggle with accurately capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity and motion smoothness.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing methods are capable of generating high-fidelity and time-consistent animation sequences in regular motions and static scenes, there are still obvious limitations when facing complex human body motions (Hypermotion) that contain highly dynamic, non-standard motions, and the lack of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation of complex human motion animations. To address this challenge, we introduce the \textbf{Open-HyperMotionX Dataset} and \textbf{HyperMotionX Bench}, which provide high-quality human pose annotations and curated video clips for evaluating and improving pose-guided human image animation models under complex human motion conditions. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful DiT-based video generation baseline and design spatial low-frequency enhanced RoPE, a novel module that selectively enhances low-frequency spatial feature modeling by introducing learnable frequency scaling. Our method significantly improves structural stability and appearance consistency in highly dynamic human motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and proposed approach in advancing the generation quality of complex human motion image animations.

Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation.

(4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation.

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

However, their large number of parameters and high computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator (TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40, setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization methods by 1.9$\times$.

However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is crucial for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, the flexible adjustment of visual attributes-such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities, and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames.

The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality.

Although recent methods exhibit strong temporal consistency, they often struggle when dealing with complex, non-repetitive human movements, leading to unnatural deformations. To tackle this issue, we present LatentMove, a DiT-based framework specifically tailored for highly dynamic human animation. Our architecture incorporates a conditional control branch and learnable face/body tokens to preserve consistency as well as fine-grained details across frames.

However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios.

However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Most recent studies have focused on reconstructing static images from EEG recordings. In this work, we propose a framework to reconstruct dynamic visual stimuli from EEG data and conduct an in-depth study of the information encoded in EEG signals. Our approach first trains a feature extraction network using a triplet-based contrastive learning strategy within an EEG-video generation framework. The extracted EEG features are then used for video synthesis with a modified StyleGAN-ADA, which incorporates temporal information as conditioning. Additionally, we analyze how different brain regions contribute to processing dynamic visual stimuli. Through several empirical studies, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and investigate how much dynamic visual information can be inferred from EEG signals.

To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal) |

However, current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems. First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level, providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part (frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks ("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model. The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex, changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos.

In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Dataset: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenS2V-Nexus</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenS2V-Nexus) |
| **[Learning Generalizable Robot Policy with Human Demonstration Video as a Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20795v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent robot learning methods commonly rely on imitation learning from massive robotic dataset collected with teleoperation. When facing a new task, such methods generally require collecting a set of new teleoperation data and finetuning the policy. Furthermore, the teleoperation data collection pipeline is also tedious and expensive. Instead, human is able to efficiently learn new tasks by just watching others do. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage framework that utilizes human demonstrations to learn a generalizable robot policy. Such policy can directly take human demonstration video as a prompt and perform new tasks without any new teleoperation data and model finetuning at all. In the first stage, we train video generation model that captures a joint representation for both the human and robot demonstration video data using cross-prediction. In the second stage, we fuse the learned representation with a shared action space between human and robot using a novel prototypical contrastive loss. Empirical evaluations on real-world dexterous manipulation tasks show the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Photography Perspective Composition: Towards Aesthetic Perspective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20655v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by detailed ablation study and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro, a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically, MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control. Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of MotionPro.

We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

| **[DriveCamSim: Generalizable Camera Simulation via Explicit Camera Modeling for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19692v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving (AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim) |

To address this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with 173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment. TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.

In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</p></details> | IJCAI2025 | None |
| **[Force Prompting: Video Generation Models Can Learn and Generalize Physics-based Control Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19386v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://force-prompting.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all from a single RGB input image.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, evaluating these policies in real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work, we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online. WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods such as real-to-sim approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://worldeval.github.io</p></details> | None |

Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code along with this paper.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures | None |

We introduce CAT-LVDM, the first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness, showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy, Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds.

| **[LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09856v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction.

By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$ end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while maintaining visual fidelity.

This requirement is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction. Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions. Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term video and action generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, these video-derived cues often suffer from low temporal resolution, motion blur, and unreliable performance under challenging lighting conditions. In contrast, event cameras inherently provide robust and high temporal-resolution motion information, offering resilience to motion blur, low-light environments, and exposure variations. In this paper, we propose EvAnimate, the first method leveraging event streams as robust and precise motion cues for conditional human image animation. Our approach is fully compatible with diffusion-based generative models, enabled by encoding asynchronous event data into a specialized three-channel representation with adaptive slicing rates and densities. High-quality and temporally coherent animations are achieved through a dual-branch architecture explicitly designed to exploit event-driven dynamics, significantly enhancing performance under challenging real-world conditions. Enhanced cross-subject generalization is further achieved using specialized augmentation strategies. To facilitate future research, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and challenging scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> | None |

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

| **[Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains.

While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process. Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity across scenes.

This inefficiency stems from two key challenges: the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1) early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench).

However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural, character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, existing video generation models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image, enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision or model tuning.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative AI for Autonomous Driving: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15863v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly advancing the field of Autonomous Driving (AD), extending beyond traditional applications in text, image, and video generation. We explore how generative models can enhance automotive tasks, such as static map creation, dynamic scenario generation, trajectory forecasting, and vehicle motion planning. By examining multiple generative approaches ranging from Variational Autoencoder (VAEs) over Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) to Generative Transformers (GTs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), we highlight and compare their capabilities and limitations for AD-specific applications. Additionally, we discuss hybrid methods integrating conventional techniques with generative approaches, and emphasize their improved adaptability and robustness. We also identify relevant datasets and outline open research questions to guide future developments in GenAI. Finally, we discuss three core challenges: safety, interpretability, and realtime capabilities, and present recommendations for image generation, dynamic scenario generation, and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Challenger: Affordable Adversarial Driving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15880v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving (AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations. Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pixtella.github.io/Challenger/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://pixtella.github.io/Challenger) |
