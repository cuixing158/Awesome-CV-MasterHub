| **[Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DASViT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13079v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-Class-Token Transformer for Multitask Self-supervised Music Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12996v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning and equivariant learning are effective methods for self-supervised learning (SSL) for audio content analysis. Yet, their application to music information retrieval (MIR) faces a dilemma: the former is more effective on tagging (e.g., instrument recognition) but less effective on structured prediction (e.g., tonality estimation); The latter can match supervised methods on the specific task it is designed for, but it does not generalize well to other tasks. In this article, we adopt a best-of-both-worlds approach by training a deep neural network on both kinds of pretext tasks at once. The proposed new architecture is a Vision Transformer with 1-D spectrogram patches (ViT-1D), equipped with two class tokens, which are specialized to different self-supervised pretext tasks but optimized through the same model: hence the qualification of self-supervised multi-class-token multitask (MT2). The former class token optimizes cross-power spectral density (CPSD) for equivariant learning over the circle of fifths, while the latter optimizes normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent) for contrastive learning. MT2 combines the strengths of both pretext tasks and outperforms consistently both single-class-token ViT-1D models trained with either contrastive or equivariant learning. Averaging the two class tokens further improves performance on several tasks, highlighting the complementary nature of the representations learned by each class token. Furthermore, using the same single-linear-layer probing method on the features of last layer, MT2 outperforms MERT on all tasks except for beat tracking; achieving this with 18x fewer parameters thanks to its multitasking capabilities. Our SSL benchmark demonstrates the versatility of our multi-class-token multitask learning approach for MIR applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unleashing Vision Foundation Models for Coronary Artery Segmentation: Parallel ViT-CNN Encoding and Variational Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12938v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE) module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization across multiple datasets.

| **[A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12784v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Compact Vision Transformer by Reduction of Kernel Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12780v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner, ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

This method also provides almost the same accuracy as models without any encryption. The above performance is achieved using a domain-adaptation technique on the embedding structure of the Vision Transformer (ViT). The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally confirmed in terms of the accuracy of semantic segmentation when using a powerful semantic-segmentation model with ViT called Segmentation Transformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

| **[Comparative Evaluation of Radiomics and Deep Learning Models for Disease Detection in Chest Radiography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12249v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revised abstract; added statistical analysis; one figure removed, three tables added; clarification of dataset usage, experimental design, and model training strategy; revised methods with details; revised discussion; defined all abbreviations; correction of typographical and numerical inconsistencies; overall language review</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Blur Multi-Model (DeepBlurMM) -- a strategy to mitigate the impact of image blur on deep learning model performance in histopathology image analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09298v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based models for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis are increasingly common, but unsharp or blurred areas within WSI can significantly reduce prediction performance. In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unit-Based Histopathology Tissue Segmentation via Multi-Level Feature Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12427v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02572v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 main-track paper (42nd International Conference on Machine Learning).

| **[Hybrid Ensemble Approaches: Optimal Deep Feature Fusion and Hyperparameter-Tuned Classifier Ensembling for Enhanced Brain Tumor Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12177v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain tumor classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Grained Image Recognition from Scratch with Teacher-Guided Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12157v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR. In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for efficient inference. Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly, ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main:...</summary><p>Main: 10 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion for Efficient Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12125v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications. Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly. Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up. BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0% on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40% speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Incremental Joint Learning of Depth, Pose and Implicit Scene Representation on Monocular Camera in Large-scale Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06050v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense scene reconstruction for photo-realistic view synthesis has various applications, such as VR/AR, autonomous vehicles. However, most existing methods have difficulties in large-scale scenes due to three core challenges: \textit{(a) inaccurate depth input.} Accurate depth input is impossible to get in real-world large-scale scenes. \textit{(b) inaccurate pose estimation.} Most existing approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses. \textit{(c) insufficient scene representation capability.} A single global radiance field lacks the capacity to effectively scale to large-scale scenes. To this end, we propose an incremental joint learning framework, which can achieve accurate depth, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction. A vision transformer-based network is adopted as the backbone to enhance performance in scale information estimation. For pose estimation, a feature-metric bundle adjustment (FBA) method is designed for accurate and robust camera tracking in large-scale scenes. In terms of implicit scene representation, we propose an incremental scene representation method to construct the entire large-scale scene as multiple local radiance fields to enhance the scalability of 3D scene representation. Extended experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method in depth estimation, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Tackling the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus with Vision Transformers: the Importance of 2D Representation, Positions, and Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06405v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Fast Fourier Correlation is a Highly Efficient and Accurate Feature Attribution Algorithm from the Perspective of Control Theory and Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02016v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of neural networks from the perspective of Fourier features has garnered significant attention. While existing analytical research suggests that neural networks tend to learn low-frequency features, a clear attribution method for identifying the specific learned Fourier features has remained elusive. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Fourier feature attribution method grounded in signal decomposition theory. Additionally, we analyze the differences between game-theoretic attribution metrics for Fourier and spatial domain features, demonstrating that game-theoretic evaluation metrics are better suited for Fourier-based feature attribution. Our experiments show that Fourier feature attribution exhibits superior feature selection capabilities compared to spatial domain attribution methods. For instance, in the case of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on the ImageNet dataset, only $8\%$ of the Fourier features are required to maintain the original predictions for $80\%$ of the samples. Furthermore, we compare the specificity of features identified by our method against traditional spatial domain attribution methods. Results reveal that Fourier features exhibit greater intra-class concentration and inter-class distinctiveness, indicating their potential for more efficient classification and explainable AI algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[ThinkingViT: Matryoshka Thinking Vision Transformer for Elastic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10800v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However, these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty. ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design, ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points (p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs on ImageNet-1K.

In imaging contexts, TDA typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving 99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45 dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures | None |

This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue.

By clustering feature activations, NAVE provides insights into learned semantics without fine-tuning. Using object localization, we show that NAVE's concepts align with image semantics. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the impact of training strategies and architectures on encoder representation capabilities. Additionally, we apply NAVE to study training artifacts in vision transformers and reveal how weak training strategies and spurious correlations degrade model performance. Our findings establish NAVE as a valuable tool for post-hoc model inspection and improving transparency in vision models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the prior map is usually incomplete due to lacking labeling in partial paths. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an OSM maker using airborne sensors carried by low-altitude aircraft, where the core of the OSM maker is a novel efficient pathfinder approach based on LiDAR and camera data, i.e., a binary dual-stream road segmentation model. Specifically, a multi-scale feature extraction based on the UNet architecture is implemented for images and point clouds. To reduce the effect caused by the sparsity of point cloud, an attention-guided gated block is designed to integrate image and point-cloud features. To optimize the model for edge deployment that significantly reduces storage footprint and computational demands, we propose a binarization streamline to each model component, including a variant of vision transformer (ViT) architecture as the encoder of the image branch, and new focal and perception losses to optimize the model training. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our pathfinder method achieves SOTA accuracy with high efficiency in finding paths from the low-level airborne sensors, and we can create complete OSM prior maps based on the segmented road skeletons.

One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba" with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.</p></details> |  | None |

The pretrained MMAE learns latent representations that capture essential microstructural features and are broadly transferable across tasks. We demonstrate two key applications: (i) predicting homogenized stiffness components through fine-tuning on limited data, and (ii) inferring physically interpretable parameters by coupling MMAE with an interaction-based material network (IMN), thereby enabling extrapolation of nonlinear stress-strain responses. These results highlight the promise of microstructure foundation models and lay the groundwork for future extensions to more complex systems, such as 3D composites and experimental datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification. Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LASER: Attention with Exponential Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03493v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have had tremendous impact for several sequence related tasks, largely due to their ability to retrieve from any part of the sequence via softmax based dot-product attention. This mechanism plays a crucial role in Transformer's performance. We analyze the gradients backpropagated through the softmax operation in the attention mechanism and observe that these gradients can often be small. This poor gradient signal backpropagation can lead to inefficient learning of parameters preceeding the attention operations. To this end, we introduce a new attention mechanism called LASER, which we analytically show to admit a larger gradient signal. We show that LASER attention can be implemented by making small modifications to existing attention implementations. We conduct experiments on autoregressive large language models (LLMs) with upto 7.7 billion parameters with an average improvement of upto 1.44% over standard attention on downstream evaluations and 1.65% finetuning improvements. Additionally, LASER demonstrates generalization performance improvement across a variety of tasks (vision, text and speech):Vision Transformer (ViT) on Imagenet, Conformer on the Librispeech speech-to-text and BERT with 2.2 billion parameters.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | None |
| **[Token Compression Meets Compact Vision Transformers: A Survey and Comparative Evaluation for Edge AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09702v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks for edge AI and AI agent applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prompt2DEM: High-Resolution DEMs for Urban and Open Environments from Global Prompts Using a Monocular Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09681v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.</p></details> | 5 figures | None |

This challenge is often addressed through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization (MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Many studies capture behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses. BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios where labeled data remains scarce.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

In this work, we introduce ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space. Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights.

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet, DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT, Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856 pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and 99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size, with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid and accurate diagnosis during health crises.</p></details> |  | None |

There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE FG 2023</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts, applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR), which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues. Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures | None |

While current markerless methods mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting. Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS) approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP) model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment sessions. Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning 4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and treatment (T2) data. Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However, MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining. Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless tumor motion forecasting.

| **[Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07796v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their substantial compute and memory demands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and bandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose OptoViT, the first near-sensor, region-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time and energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid electronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles compute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and normalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and patch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet) that identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant patches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using quantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic constraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture co-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that OptoViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6% accuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the edge.</p></details> |  | None |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation, which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements on fine-grained datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches often rely on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple [CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote [CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it faces challenges such as limited bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO) reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency, bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
| **[Correlative and Discriminative Label Grouping for Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09990v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling label correlations has always played a pivotal role in multi-label image classification (MLC), attracting significant attention from researchers. However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason. In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

There is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performing and computationally efficient, capable of being deployed on remote systems with limited resources. Although transformers can capture global dependencies in the input space, they face challenges from the corresponding high computational and storage expenses involved. This research investigates the integration of CNNs with Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM)s by introducing the novel U-VixLSTM. The Vision-xLSTM blocks capture the temporal and global relationships within the patches extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms an appropriate backbone for medical image segmentation, offering excellent performance with reduced computational costs.

Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (highlight)</p></details> | None |

We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PromptSR: Cascade Prompting for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04118v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative, qualitative, and complexity evaluations.

As a result, they waste computational resources - particularly when small objects are to be segmented in high-resolution scenes. We introduce FLIP (Fovea-Like Input Patching), a parameter-efficient vision model that realizes object segmentation through biologically-inspired top-down attention. FLIP selectively samples multi-resolution patches centered on objects of interest from the input. As a result, it allocates high-resolution processing to object centers while maintaining coarser peripheral context. This off-grid, scale-invariant design enables FLIP to outperform META's Segment Anything models (SAM) by large margins: With more than 1000x fewer parameters, FLIP-Tiny (0.51M parameters) reaches a mean IoU of 78.24% while SAM-H reaches 75.41% IoU (641.1M parameters). FLIP-Large even achieves 80.33% mean IoU (96.6M parameters), still running about 6$\times$ faster than SAM-H. We evaluate on six benchmarks in total. In five established benchmarks (Hypersim, KITTI-360, OpenImages, COCO, LVIS) FLIP consistently outperforms SAM and various variants of it. In our novel ObjaScale dataset, which stress-tests scale invariance with objects ranging from 0.0001% up-to 25% of the image area, we show that FLIP segments even very small objects accurately, where existing models fail severely. FLIP opens new possibilities for real-time, object-centric vision applications and offers much higher energy efficiency. We believe that FLIP can act as a powerful foundation model, as it is very well-suited to track objects over time, for example, when being integrated into slot-based scene segmentation architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

Catastrophic forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones. Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing, it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution. In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust, fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images, underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable, cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected, affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists' capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs), particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel, vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT, a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for scenarios radiologists might encounter.

Existing MUL research involves fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model. We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information, validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision transformers.

We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention. To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16025v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones is Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at $224 \times 224$px, while the "high-resolution" versions are around $378-448$px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-resolution vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model training using RADIO as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism, evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models. More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven baseline.

| **[Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01788v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%.

Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus, carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy. In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency. We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.</p></details> |  | None |

This constraint prevents models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning, drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage rather than an imposed limitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Workshop on Efficient Computing under Limited Resources: Visual Computing (ICCV 2025).

Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

With the growing adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs), DFQ for ViTs has garnered significant attention. However, existing DFQ methods exhibit two limitations: (1) semantic distortion, where the semantics of synthetic images deviate substantially from those of real images, and (2) semantic inadequacy, where synthetic images contain extensive regions with limited content and oversimplified textures, leading to suboptimal quantization performance. To address these limitations, we propose SARDFQ, a novel Semantics Alignment and Reinforcement Data-Free Quantization method for ViTs. To address semantic distortion, SARDFQ incorporates Attention Priors Alignment (APA), which optimizes synthetic images to follow randomly generated structure attention priors. To mitigate semantic inadequacy, SARDFQ introduces Multi-Semantic Reinforcement (MSR), leveraging localized patch optimization to enhance semantic richness across synthetic images. Furthermore, SARDFQ employs Soft-Label Learning (SL), wherein multiple semantic targets are adapted to facilitate the learning of multi-semantic images augmented by MSR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SARDFQ, significantly surpassing existing methods. For example, SARDFQ improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 15.52% for W4A4 ViT-B.

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

| **[Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple and Effective Strategy for Clustering Vision Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13337v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 | None |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level. Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the feature representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 8figures, 4tables</p></details> | None |

Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications.

Direct fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and (2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks, showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for visual understanding.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution.

| **[BadViM: Backdoor Attack against Vision Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00577v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture, especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop, PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

Handling the low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head", akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head) |

Bayesian theory can provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM, SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in handling uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> | None |

This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks, thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks, based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework.

Network pruning reduces the computational complexity by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However, pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones. Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements. In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.</p></details> | ICCV'25 Workshops | None |
| **[Deep Unlearn: Benchmarking Machine Unlearning for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01276v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EuroS&P 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Robustness and Reliability in Medical Image Classification with Latent-Guided Diffusion and Nested-Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15952v5)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once deployed, medical image analysis methods are often faced with unexpected image corruptions and noise perturbations. These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ReMem: Mutual Information-Aware Fine-tuning of Pretrained Vision Transformers for Effective Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23041v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However, the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer. Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those pretrained models among the strongest.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RecConv: Efficient Recursive Convolutions for Multi-Frequency Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19628v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective receptive field $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities.

In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[Generalized Linear Mode Connectivity for Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22712v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths, despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations -- which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes: permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Demystifying Singular Defects in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07004v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large transformer models are known to produce high-norm tokens. In vision transformers (ViTs), such tokens have been mathematically modeled through the singular vectors of the linear approximations of layers. However, in large language models (LLMs), the underlying causes of high-norm tokens remain largely unexplored, and their different properties from those of ViTs require a new analysis framework. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical validation across a range of recent models, leading to the following observations: i) The layer-wise singular direction predicts the abrupt explosion of token norms in LLMs. ii) The negative eigenvalues of a layer explain its sudden decay. iii) The computational pathways leading to high-norm tokens differ between initial and noninitial tokens. iv) High-norm tokens are triggered by the right leading singular vector of the matrix approximating the corresponding modules. We showcase two practical applications of these findings: the improvement of quantization schemes and the design of LLM signatures. Our findings not only advance the understanding of singular defects in LLMs but also open new avenues for their application. We expect that this work will stimulate further research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/haoqiwang/singular_defect.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/haoqiwang/singular_defect) |

These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables.

Continuous maritime ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations, we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS, which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs, ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features.

| **[Learning to Be a Transformer to Pinpoint Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04092v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently deploy strong, often pre-trained feature extractors, recent Industrial Anomaly Detection and Segmentation (IADS) methods process low-resolution images, e.g., 224x224 pixels, obtained by downsampling the original input images. However, while numerous industrial applications demand the identification of both large and small defects, downsampling the input image to a low resolution may hinder a method's ability to pinpoint tiny anomalies. We propose a novel Teacher--Student paradigm to leverage strong pre-trained features while processing high-resolution input images very efficiently. The core idea concerns training two shallow MLPs (the Students) by nominal images so as to mimic the mappings between the patch embeddings induced by the self-attention layers of a frozen vision Transformer (the Teacher). Indeed, learning these mappings sets forth a challenging pretext task that small-capacity models are unlikely to accomplish on out-of-distribution data such as anomalous images. Our method can spot anomalies from high-resolution images and runs way faster than competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and the best segmentation results on VisA. We also propose novel evaluation metrics to capture robustness to defect size, i.e., the ability to preserve good localisation from large anomalies to tiny ones. Evaluating our method also by these metrics reveals its neatly superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

This potential stems from their ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.</p></details> |  | None |

However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent global transferability and robustness.

By exploiting intermediate features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs. Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts.

Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures | None |

Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens.

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available. State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance. We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network.

However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding cortical prototypes.

However, existing methods primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging, overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT, making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

These approaches do not explicitly account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling. Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG. Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures | None |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR, effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a conference paper at the 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)</p></details> | None |

Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  | None |

BrainSAIL leverages recent advances in large-scale artificial neural networks, using them to provide insights into the functional topology of the brain. To overcome the challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural images, BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. This provides a powerful tool for dissecting the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic visual processing for natural images. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts. Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth, luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the human brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025, code: https://github.com/aluo-x/BrainSAIL</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/aluo-x/BrainSAIL) |
| **[An Exploratory Approach Towards Investigating and Explaining Vision Transformer and Transfer Learning for Brain Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16039v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks, including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions, offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting MRI scans can be complicated. This study tackles this challenge by conducting a comparative analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transfer Learning (TL) models such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2 for classifying brain diseases using MRI data from Bangladesh based dataset. ViT, known for their ability to capture global relationships in images, are particularly effective for medical imaging tasks. Transfer learning helps to mitigate data constraints by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, and Faster-ScoreCAM are employed to interpret model predictions. The results demonstrate that ViT surpasses transfer learning models, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.39%. The integration of XAI methods enhances model transparency, offering crucial insights to aid medical professionals in diagnosing brain diseases with greater precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2024 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> | None |
| **[Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms. Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5\% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP). 11 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Focus Your Attention: Towards Data-Intuitive Lightweight Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18791v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

| **[Deep CNN Face Matchers Inherently Support Revocable Biometric Templates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18731v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2) strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based deep CNN backbones.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

This project proposes to solve that by developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal disorders in under-resourced areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures.

In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer, with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of 10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures | None |

Some previous methods either do not fully exploit the potential of RGB and TIR information for channel and spatial feature fusion or lack a direct interaction between the template and the search area, which limits the model's ability to fully utilize the original semantic information of both modalities. To address these limitations, we investigate how to achieve a direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features in RGB-T tracking and propose CSTNet. It uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and adds a Joint Spatial and Channel Fusion Module (JSCFM) and Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) integrated between the transformer blocks to facilitate cross-modal feature interaction. The JSCFM module achieves joint modeling of channel and multi-level spatial features. The SFM module includes a cross-attention-like architecture for cross modeling and joint learning of RGB and TIR features. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To enhance practicality, we retrain the model without JSCFM and SFM modules and use CSNet as the pretraining weight, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 50% speedup with an average decrease of 1-2% in SR and PR performance. CSTNet and CSTNet-small achieve real-time speeds of 21 fps and 33 fps on the Nvidia Jetson Xavier, meeting actual deployment requirements.

Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at The 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Biological networks can function stably even under dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD) algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available here: https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/lmd</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/lmd) |

While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes.

| **[From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery in Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17052v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing compression techniques require additional end-to-end fine-tuning or incur a significant drawback to runtime, making them ill-suited for online (real-time) inference, where a prediction is made on any new input as it comes in. We introduce the $\textbf{Visual Word Tokenizer}$ (VWT), a training-free method for reducing energy costs while retaining performance and runtime. The VWT groups visual subwords (image patches) that are frequently used into visual words while infrequent ones remain intact. To do so, $\textit{intra}$-image or $\textit{inter}$-image statistics are leveraged to identify similar visual concepts for sequence compression. Experimentally, we demonstrate a reduction in wattage of up to 25% with only a 20% increase in runtime at most. Comparative approaches of 8-bit quantization and token merging achieve a lower or similar energy efficiency but exact a higher toll on runtime (up to 100% or more). Our results indicate that VWTs are well-suited for efficient online inference with a marginal compromise on performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and speeds up inference, it often degrades performance, especially in low-bit settings. We identify two key reasons for the performance degradation: 1) existing quantization methods fail to align with the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations, and 2) reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations leads to a performance drop due to the significant influence of outliers in the scaling factors. To address these challenges, we propose DopQ-ViT, a Distribution-friendly and Outlier-aware Post-training Quantization method for ViTs. First, DopQ-ViT introduces the Tan Quantizer (TanQ), which better preserves the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations by focusing more on values near 1. Second, DopQ-ViT presents the MAD-guided Optimal Scaling Factor (MOSF), which selects the optimal scaling factor without introducing additional calculations. Extensive experiments across various ViT models and quantization settings demonstrate that DopQ-ViT, with the help of TanQ and MOSF, outperforms previous PTQ methods on both classification and detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal</p></details> | None |

Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in European Journal of Radiology Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
| **[Prompt-based Dynamic Token Pruning to Guide Transformer Attention in Efficient Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16369v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training, maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of $\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework, facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%, while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance systems into emergency management systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing auto-pruning methods face challenges due to the diversity of DNN models, various operators (e.g., filters), and the difficulty in balancing pruning granularity with model accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoSculpt, a pattern-based automated pruning framework designed to enhance efficiency and accuracy by leveraging graph learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). AutoSculpt automatically identifies and prunes regular patterns within DNN architectures that can be recognized by existing inference engines, enabling runtime acceleration. Three key steps in AutoSculpt include: (1) Constructing DNNs as graphs to encode their topology and parameter dependencies, (2) embedding computationally efficient pruning patterns, and (3) utilizing DRL to iteratively refine auto-pruning strategies until the optimal balance between compression and accuracy is achieved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSculpt across various architectures, including ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, and Vision Transformer, achieving pruning rates of up to 90% and nearly 18% improvement in FLOPs reduction, outperforming all baselines.

However, these advancements are not solely attributable to novel feature transformation designs; certain benefits also arise from advanced network-level and block-level architectures. This paper aims to identify the real gains of popular convolution and attention operators through a detailed study. We find that the key difference among these feature transformation modules, such as attention or convolution, lies in their spatial feature aggregation approach, known as the "spatial token mixer" (STM). To facilitate an impartial comparison, we introduce a unified architecture to neutralize the impact of divergent network-level and block-level designs. Subsequently, various STMs are integrated into this unified framework for comprehensive comparative analysis. Our experiments on various tasks and an analysis of inductive bias show a significant performance boost due to advanced network-level and block-level designs, but performance differences persist among different STMs. Our detailed analysis also reveals various findings about different STMs, including effective receptive fields, invariance, and adversarial robustness tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE TPAMI).

| **[Polyline Path Masked Attention for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15940v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

| **[AnchorFormer: Differentiable Anchor Attention for Efficient Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16463v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches. Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiably learn these anchors and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. It avoids the burden caused by non-differentiable operations and further speeds up the approximate attention. Moreover, we extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this issue and propose MSVIT. This novel spike-driven Transformer architecture firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enhance the capabilities of spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main datasets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among SNN-transformer architectures.

We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Third International Workshop on Generalizing from Limited Resources in the Open World Workshop at International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2025</p></details> | None |

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 29 references</p></details> | None |

This limitation significantly affects depth map and point cloud-reliant applications, especially in robotic manipulation. We developed a vision transformer-based algorithm for stereo depth recovery of transparent objects. This approach is complemented by an innovative feature post-fusion module, which enhances the accuracy of depth recovery by structural features in images. To address the high costs associated with dataset collection for stereo camera-based perception of transparent objects, our method incorporates a parameter-aligned, domain-adaptive, and physically realistic Sim2Real simulation for efficient data generation, accelerated by AI algorithm.

The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers. Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

| **[DepthSeg: Depth prompting in remote sensing semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14382v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing semantic segmentation is crucial for extracting detailed land surface information, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring, land use planning, and resource assessment. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks. Detailed ablation studies further highlight the significance of the depth prompts in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

These models typically rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which process video frames individually to extract visual embeddings. However, generating embeddings for large-scale videos requires ViT inferencing across numerous frames, posing a major hurdle to real-world deployment and necessitating solutions for integration into scalable video data management systems. This paper introduces D\'ej\`a Vu, a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is ReuseViT, a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this, D\'ej\`a Vu integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains. Evaluations on three VideoLM tasks show that D\'ej\`a Vu accelerates embedding generation by up to a 2.64x within a 2% error bound, dramatically enhancing the practicality of VideoLMs for large-scale video analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 VLDB</p></details> | None |

A Study on the Sim-to-Real Gap in Traffic Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13722v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are gaining traction in traffic monitoring applications due to their low latency, high temporal resolution, and energy efficiency, which makes them well-suited for real-time object detection at traffic intersections. However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this, several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data. Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential, the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic vision for traffic monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |

We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual datasets. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99\% on average for individual datasets and 99.4\% accuracy for the combined dataset. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future work will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a significant advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 12 tables</p></details> | None |

We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IMPACT 2025</p></details> | None |

This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

While PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX. Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3) replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding. Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental diagnostics.</p></details> | 10 figures, 19 pages | None |

A major challenge in ViT hardware acceleration is that the model family contains complex arithmetic operations that are sensitive to model accuracy, such as the Softmax and LayerNorm operations, which cannot be mapped onto efficient hardware with low precision. Existing methods only exploit parallelism in the matrix multiplication operations of the model on hardware and keep these complex operations on the CPU. This results in suboptimal performance due to the communication overhead between the CPU and accelerator. Can new data formats solve this problem? In this work, we present the first ViT accelerator that maps all operations of the ViT models onto FPGAs. We exploit a new arithmetic format named Microscaling Integer (MXInt) for datapath designs and evaluate how different design choices can be made to trade off accuracy, hardware performance, and hardware utilization. Our contributions are twofold. First, we quantize ViTs using the MXInt format, achieving both high area efficiency and accuracy. Second, we propose MXInt-specific hardware optimization that map these complex arithmetic operations into custom hardware. Within 1\% accuracy loss, our method achieves at least 93$\times$ speedup compared to Float16 and at least 1.9$\times$ speedup compared to related work.</p></details> | Accepted at FPL'2025 | None |

However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process, preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating its efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The components are designed as plug-and-play for different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications.

Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often fail to preserve topological continuity, while recent Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, although strong in global context modeling, lack precise boundary awareness. In this work, we introduce BAVT, a Boundary-Aware Vision Transformer, a ViT-based architecture enhanced with an edge-aware loss that explicitly guides the segmentation toward fine-grained vascular boundaries. Unlike hybrid transformer-CNN models, BAVT retains a minimal, scalable structure that is fully compatible with large-scale vision foundation model (VFM) pretraining. We validate our approach on the DCA-1 coronary angiography dataset, where BAVT achieves superior performance across medical image segmentation metrics outperforming both CNN and hybrid baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining plain ViT encoders with boundary-aware supervision for clinical-grade vascular segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; submitted to IPTA-2025</p></details> | None |

GM-LDM integrates a 3D autoencoder, pre-trained on the large-scale ABCD MRI dataset, achieving statistical consistency through KL divergence loss. We employ a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based encoder-decoder as the denoising network to optimize generation quality. The framework flexibly incorporates conditional data, such as functional network connectivity (FNC) data, enabling personalized brain imaging, biomarker identification, and functional-to-structural information translation for brain diseases like schizophrenia.</p></details> |  | None |

We compare these with existing features. Notably, our handcrafted features outperform eGeMAPs with a relative improvement of $14.2\%$ in classification accuracy and comparable performance in the regression task.

We investigate three distinct approaches: a custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features. Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes (ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2 fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation, highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential. Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Drawing inspiration from the brain's ability to integrate global and local information for comprehensive visual understanding, we propose Stepwise Patch Merging (SPM), which enhances the subsequent attention mechanism's ability to 'see' better. SPM consists of Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) and Guided Local Enhancement (GLE) striking a proper balance between long-range dependency modeling and local feature enhancement. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K, demonstrate that SPM significantly improves the performance of various models, particularly in dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Meanwhile, experiments show that combining SPM with different backbones can further improve performance.

The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a novel double ensembling framework that synergistically combines pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction with optimized machine learning (ML) classifiers for robust classification. The framework incorporates comprehensive preprocessing and data augmentation of brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), followed by deep feature extraction using transfer learning with pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) networks. The novelty lies in the dual-level ensembling strategy: feature-level ensembling, which integrates deep features from the top-performing ViT models, and classifier-level ensembling, which aggregates predictions from hyperparameter-optimized ML classifiers. Experiments on two public Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the importance of feature and classifier fusion. The proposed methodology also highlights the critical roles of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and advanced preprocessing techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability, advancing the integration of DL and ML for clinically relevant medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models.

However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.</p></details> |  | None |

Although effective, traditional petrographic analysis is time-consuming. This study explores the application of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), as complementary tools to support the classification of Levantine ceramics based on their petrographic fabrics. A dataset of 1,424 thin section images from 178 ceramic samples belonging to several archaeological sites across the Levantine area, mostly from the Bronze Age, with few samples dating to the Iron Age, was used to train and evaluate these models. The results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves classification performance, with a ResNet18 model achieving 92.11% accuracy and a ViT reaching 88.34%. Explainability techniques, including Guided Grad-CAM and attention maps, were applied to interpret and visualize the models' decisions, revealing that both CNNs and ViTs successfully focus on key mineralogical features for the classification of the samples into their respective petrographic fabrics. These findings highlight the potential of explainable AI in archaeometric studies, providing a reproducible and efficient methodology for ceramic analysis while maintaining transparency in model decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Machine Learning: Science and Technology</p></details> | None |

We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93).

| **[How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11976v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

We have shown that transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks. The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer from the transferability of adversarial examples.</p></details> |  | None |

Model quantization, particularly to low bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop, while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization ``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential ``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32 while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2 quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32 training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting multiple vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately 62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures | None |

Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration.

| **[Vision Transformers for Multi-Variable Climate Downscaling: Emulating Regional Climate Models with a Shared Encoder and Multi-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22447v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind), and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs, emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate downscaling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HyBiomass: Global Hyperspectral Imagery Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Geospatial Foundation Models in Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11314v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However, most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The dataset and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PiPViT: Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes for Retinal Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10669v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales. Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

| **[Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

By combining MHLA alongside a reparameterized token mixer, FaceLiVT effectively reduces computational complexity while preserving competitive accuracy. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks; including LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB-30, IJB-B, and IJB-C; highlight its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace, a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2 faster than a pure ViT-Based model. With its balanced design, FaceLiVT offers an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> | 2025 ICIP | None |

This necessitates continual learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL, particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers (ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural language processing tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | None |

Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50 (ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen), uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions. This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However, this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform, augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics. Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic settings.

| **[Auto-Compressing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09714v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the accuracy and fairness of these algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as part of the 2025 19th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) Workshop Proceedings</p></details> | None |
| **[Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product, alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice (quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context. Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification and measurement.</p></details> | 15 pages, 41 figures | None |

However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings.

Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Inherently Faithful Attention Maps for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08915v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.</p></details> |  | None |
