| **[MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters, MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/lanl/MORPH) |
| **[Putting a Face to Forgetting: Continual Learning meets Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22012v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rotary Position Encodings for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22259v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the extent to which rotary position encodings (RoPE), a recent transformer position encoding algorithm broadly adopted in large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs), can be applied to graph-structured data. We find that rotating tokens depending on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian efficiently injects structural information into the attention mechanism, boosting performance in synthetic and real-world graph learning tasks. This approach, coined _Wave-Induced Rotary Encodings_ (WIRE), enjoys intriguing theoretical properties: it recovers regular RoPE on grids, and depends asymptotically on the graph effective resistance. Unlike bias-based relative position encodings, WIRE is compatible with linear attention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Semantic Segmentation with Continual Self-Supervised Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17816v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training foundation models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, often producing representations with strong generalization capabilities. These models are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While prior work has investigated parameter-efficient adaptation methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning, primarily targeting downstream finetuning, extending the SSL pre-training itself in a continual manner to new domains under limited data remains largely underexplored, especially for downstream dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this work, we address the challenge of adapting vision foundation models to low-data target domains through continual self-supervised pre-training, specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE (Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised pre-training task designed to enhance downstream semantic segmentation performance. GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only lightweight adapter modules specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[ViTMAlis: Towards Latency-Critical Mobile Video Analytics with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21362v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[An explainable vision transformer with transfer learning based efficient drought stress identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21666v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Youtu-Parsing: Perception, Structuring and Recognition via High-Parallelism Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20430v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visual Instruction Pretraining for Domain-Specific Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17562v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

| **[PLANA3R: Zero-shot Metric Planar 3D Reconstruction via Feed-Forward Planar Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18714v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments - we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation.

| **[SiNGER: A Clearer Voice Distills Vision Transformers Further](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20986v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 12 pages (including 3 pages of references), 6 figures, 6 tables.

| **[Visual Prompt-Agnostic Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20232v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks by inserting a small number of learnable prompt tokens into the token sequence at each layer. However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Beyond performance, $\mathtt{PAE}$ is prompt-agnostic and lightweight, and it integrates seamlessly with diverse VPT variants without backbone modification or inference-time changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[NucFuseRank: Dataset Fusion and Performance Ranking for Nuclei Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20104v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclei instance segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images plays an important role in automated histological image analysis, with various applications in downstream tasks. While several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for nuclei instance segmentation, most research in this field focuses on developing new segmentation algorithms and benchmarking them on a limited number of arbitrarily selected public datasets. In this work, rather than focusing on model development, we focused on the datasets used for this task. Based on an extensive literature review, we identified manually annotated, publicly available datasets of H&E-stained images for nuclei instance segmentation and standardized them into a unified input and annotation format. Using two state-of-the-art segmentation models, one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one based on a hybrid CNN and vision transformer architecture, we systematically evaluated and ranked these datasets based on their nuclei instance segmentation performance. Furthermore, we proposed a unified test set (NucFuse-test) for fair cross-dataset evaluation and a unified training set (NucFuse-train) for improved segmentation performance by merging images from multiple datasets. By evaluating and ranking the datasets, performing comprehensive analyses, generating fused datasets, conducting external validation, and making our implementation publicly available, we provided a new benchmark for training, testing, and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models on H&E-stained histological images.</p></details> | 31 pages | None |
| **[Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoders: Unlocking Vision Transformer Potential with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20072v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of training Vision Transformers (ViTs) when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels). Our results demonstrate that when pseudo-labels are introduced is as important as how they are generated for data-efficient transformer training.

| **[SONIC: Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19884v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[HexFormer: Hyperbolic Vision Transformer with Exponential Map Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19849v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PaW-ViT: A Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer for Robust Ear Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19771v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Creating a Causally Grounded Rating Method for Assessing the Robustness of AI Models for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12226v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models, including both time-series-specific and general-purpose Foundation Models (FMs), have demonstrated strong potential in time-series forecasting across sectors like finance. However, these models are highly sensitive to input perturbations, which can lead to prediction errors and undermine trust among stakeholders, including investors and analysts. To address this challenge, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to systematically evaluate model robustness by analyzing statistical and confounding biases under various noisy and erroneous input scenarios. Our framework is applied to a large-scale experimental setup involving stock price data from multiple industries and evaluates both uni-modal and multi-modal models, including Vision Transformer-based (ViT) models and FMs. We introduce six types of input perturbations and twelve data distributions to assess model performance. Results indicate that multi-modal and time-series-specific FMs demonstrate greater robustness and accuracy compared to general-purpose models. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing time-series models' prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirms that our ratings reduce the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different models. Our findings can help stakeholders understand model behaviors in terms of robustness and accuracy for better decision-making even without access to the model weights and training data, i.e., black-box settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.12908</p></details> | None |
| **[FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L Δσ_l^2)/(S K R ε^2)}+(L Δ)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation technology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 20 figures | None |
| **[When Swin Transformer Meets KANs: An Improved Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04084v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation.

| **[Efficient Complex-Valued Vision Transformers for MRI Classification Directly from k-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18392v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly operate on reconstructed magnitude images, a process that discards phase information and requires computationally expensive transforms. Standard neural network architectures rely on local operations (convolutions or grid-patches) that are ill-suited for the global, non-local nature of raw frequency-domain (k-Space) data. In this work, we propose a novel complex-valued Vision Transformer (kViT) designed to perform classification directly on k-Space data. To bridge the geometric disconnect between current architectures and MRI physics, we introduce a radial k-Space patching strategy that respects the spectral energy distribution of the frequency-domain. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and in-house datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves classification performance competitive with state-of-the-art image-domain baselines (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT). Crucially, kViT exhibits superior robustness to high acceleration factors and offers a paradigm shift in computational efficiency, reducing VRAM consumption during training by up to 68$\times$ compared to standard methods.

Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 Pa...</summary><p>33 Pages, 8 Tables, Figures 16</p></details> | None |

We present a computational methodology for systematically exploring and analyzing the relationships among convergence, pruning, and quantization. The workflow first performs a structured design sweep across a large set of architectures, then evaluates convergence behavior, pruning sensitivity, and quantization robustness on representative models. Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

Existing methods, however, often provide a limited view. We propose the Triangle of Similarity, a framework that combines three complementary perspectives: static representational similarity (CKA/Procrustes), functional similarity (Linear Mode Connectivity or Predictive Similarity), and sparsity similarity (robustness under pruning). Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core. This framework offers a more holistic approach for assessing whether models have converged on similar internal mechanisms, providing a useful tool for model selection and analysis in scientific research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on AI for Scientific Research (AI4Research)</p></details> | None |

In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the quadratic complexity ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) of standard self-attention poses a severe barrier for high-resolution biomedical tasks, effectively excluding resource-constrained research labs from utilizing state-of-the-art models. To address this computational bottleneck without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy, we propose \textbf{MIRAM}, a Multi-scale Masked Autoencoder that leverages a \textbf{hybrid-attention mechanism}. Our architecture uniquely decouples semantic learning from detail reconstruction using a dual-decoder design: a standard transformer decoder captures global semantics at low resolution, while a linear-complexity decoder (comparing Linformer, Performer, and Nyströmformer) handles the computationally expensive high-resolution reconstruction. This reduces the complexity of the upscaling stage from quadratic to linear ($\mathcal{O}(N)$), enabling high-fidelity training on consumer-grade GPUs. We validate our approach on the CBIS-DDSM mammography dataset. Remarkably, our \textbf{Nyströmformer-based variant} achieves a classification accuracy of \textbf{61.0\%}, outperforming both standard MAE (58.9\%) and MoCo-v3 (60.2\%) while requiring significantly less memory. These results demonstrate that hybrid-attention architectures can democratize high-resolution medical AI, making powerful SSL accessible to researchers with limited hardware resources.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PanoNormal: Monocular Indoor 360° Surface Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18745v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of spherical distortion in equirectangular projection (ERP) images presents a persistent challenge in dense regression tasks such as surface normal estimation. Although it may appear straightforward to repurpose architectures developed for 360° depth estimation, our empirical findings indicate that such models yield suboptimal performance when applied to surface normal prediction. This is largely attributed to their architectural bias toward capturing global scene layout, which comes at the expense of the fine-grained local geometric cues that are critical for accurate surface orientation estimation. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to mitigate spherical distortion, their fixed receptive fields limit their ability to capture holistic scene structure. Conversely, vision transformers (ViTs) are capable of modeling long-range dependencies via global self-attention, but often fail to preserve high-frequency local detail. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{PanoNormal}, a monocular surface normal estimation architecture for 360° images that integrates the complementary strengths of CNNs and ViTs. In particular, we design a multi-level global self-attention mechanism that explicitly accounts for the spherical feature distribution, enabling our model to recover both global contextual structure and local geometric details. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark 360° datasets, but also significantly outperforms adapted depth estimation models on the task of surface normal prediction.

This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report benchmarking off-the-shelf CV latencies on commodity CPU hardware for therapeutic VR applications</p></details> | None |

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> | None |

These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Vision Transformer_GAN Attribute Neutralizer for Mitigating Bias in Chest X_Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15490v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.</p></details> |  | None |

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a quadratic similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in DINO, CLIP, and ImageNet-supervised ViTs, but is markedly weaker in MAE, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

While ViT-based pipelines offer strong geometric priors, they are often constrained by low-resolution inputs due to computational costs. Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details. We develop a feature-guided diffusion network, which can preserve high-frequency details during the restoration process. We introduce a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of the ViT-based geometric backbone and the diffusion-based refinement module. Experiments demonstrate that our method can maintain superior generation quality across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

To preserve the SO(2)-equivariance of environment maps, we use a novel Vector Neuron Vision Transformer (VN-ViT) as encoder and a rotation-equivariant conditional neural field as decoder. In the encoder, we reduce the equivariance from SO(3) to SO(2) using a novel SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer, an extension of Vector Neurons. We show that our SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer outperforms standard Vector Neurons when used in our SO(2)-equivariant model.

We challenge this assumption and propose \textbf{Calibration Attention (CalAttn)}, a \emph{representation-aware} calibration module for vision transformers that couples instance-wise temperature scaling to transformer token geometry under a proper scoring objective. CalAttn predicts a sample-specific temperature from the \texttt{[CLS]} token and backpropagates calibration gradients into the backbone, thereby reshaping the uncertainty structure of the representation rather than post-hoc adjusting confidence. This yields \emph{token-conditioned uncertainty modulation} with negligible overhead (\(<0.1\%\) additional parameters). Across multiple datasets with ViT/DeiT/Swin backbones, CalAttn consistently improves calibration while preserving accuracy, achieving relative ECE reductions of \(3.7\%\) to \(77.7\%\) over strong baselines across diverse training objectives.

Despite their popularity, the faithfulness and reliability of these heatmap-based explanations remain under scrutiny. This study critically investigates whether Grad-CAM truly represents the internal decision-making of deep models trained for lung cancer image classification. Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful. Our findings aim to inspire a more cautious and rigorous adoption of visual explanation tools in medical AI, urging the community to rethink what it truly means to "trust" a model's explanation.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

Topological stabilizer codes are particularly appealing due to their geometric locality and practical relevance. In these codes, stabilizer measurements yield a syndrome that must be decoded into a recovery operation, making decoding a central bottleneck for scalable real time operation. Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance. In this work, we propose QuantumSMoE, a quantum vision transformer based decoder that incorporates code structure through plus shaped embeddings and adaptive masking to capture local interactions and lattice connectivity, and improves scalability via a mixture of experts layer with a novel auxiliary loss. Experiments on the toric code demonstrate that QuantumSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning decoders as well as widely used classical baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures | None |

This yields unpredictable inference latency in deployment scenarios where strict Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation budgets must be met. We propose AgenticPruner, a framework utilizing large language models to achieve MAC-constrained optimization through iterative strategy learning. Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search. Building upon isomorphic pruning's graph-based structural grouping, our method adds context-aware adaptation by analyzing patterns across pruning iterations, enabling automatic convergence to target MAC budgets within user-defined tolerance bands. We validate our framework on ImageNet-1K across ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DeiT architectures. On CNNs, our approach achieves MAC targeting while maintaining or improving accuracy: ResNet-50 reaches 1.77G MACs with 77.04% accuracy (+0.91% vs baseline); ResNet-101 achieves 4.22G MACs with 78.94% accuracy (+1.56% vs baseline). For ConvNeXt-Small, pruning to 8.17G MACs yields 1.41x GPU and 1.07x CPU speedup with 45% parameter reduction. On Vision Transformers, we demonstrate MAC-budget compliance within user-defined tolerance bands (typically +1% to +5% overshoot, -5% to -15% undershoot), establishing feasibility for deployment scenarios requiring strict computational guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 2 figures, 14 tables</p></details> | None |

Benchmarking 2D and 3D Classification, Segmentation, and Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06467v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialised domains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) pre-trained on natural images, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific fine-tuning. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D and 3D classification, segmentation, and registration on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyse its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialisation, such as in whole-slide images (WSIs), electron microscopy (EM), and positron emission tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently follow the scaling law in the medical domain. Its performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviours across tasks. Overall, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern multimodal recommendation models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the multimodal recommendation community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECIR 2026</p></details> | None |

Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures | None |

Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026, London, UK, and will be presented in the corresponding session</p></details> | None |

We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. To mimic constrained-data scenarios, we evaluate our approach on ImageNet-1K pre-training and ADE20K fine-tuning using randomly sampled subsets of each dataset. Under this setting, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications.

Data augmentation -- particularly mask-based information dropping -- can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and risk discarding essential semantics. We propose Granular Ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular Ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements not only in image classification and masked image reconstruction, but also in image tampering detection, validating the effectiveness and generalization of GBGM across both recognition and forensic scenarios. Simple and model-agnostic, GBGM integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers, offering a practical paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions. We further demonstrate effective detection and analysis of adversarial patches and adversarial samples using perceptual hashing and segmentation, achieving an SSIM of 0.95.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a preprint.

Recent research in this area has shown promise in focusing on identification of semantic elements as they are commonly depicted on ancient coins, by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper is the first to apply the recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning architecture to the task of identification of semantic elements on coins, using fully automatic learning from multi-modal data (images and unstructured text). This article summarises previous research in the area, discusses the training and implementation of ViT and CNN models for ancient coins analysis and provides an evaluation of their performance. The ViT models were found to outperform the newly trained CNN models in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond the final layer: Attentive multilayer fusion for vision transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09322v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |

Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.The project is available at https://github.com/weicongpang/LVC2-DViT.git</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/weicongpang/LVC2-DViT.git) |

Recent pathology-specific foundation models have further advanced performance by leveraging large-scale pretraining. However, standard ViTs remain inherently non-equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections, which are ubiquitous variations in histopathology imaging. To address this limitation, we propose Equi-ViT, which integrates an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of a ViT architecture, imparting built-in rotational equivariance to learned representations. Equi-ViT achieves superior rotation-consistent patch embeddings and stable classification performance across image orientations. Our results on a public colorectal cancer dataset demonstrate that incorporating equivariant patch embedding enhances data efficiency and robustness, suggesting that equivariant transformers could potentially serve as more generalizable backbones for the application of ViT in histopathology, such as digital pathology foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2026 4-page paper</p></details> | None |

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the existence of many operator learning algorithms to approximate such PDEs, we find that accurate models are not necessarily computationally efficient and vice versa. We address this issue by proposing a geometry aware operator transformer (GAOT) for learning PDEs on arbitrary domains. GAOT combines novel multiscale attentional graph neural operator encoders and decoders, together with geometry embeddings and (vision) transformer processors to accurately map information about the domain and the inputs into a robust approximation of the PDE solution. Multiple innovations in the implementation of GAOT also ensure computational efficiency and scalability. We demonstrate this significant gain in both accuracy and efficiency of GAOT over several baselines on a large number of learning tasks from a diverse set of PDEs, including achieving state of the art performance on three large scale three-dimensional industrial CFD datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted/To be presented at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

This task is usually addressed with automated crater detection algorithms (CDA) based on deep learning techniques. It is non-trivial due to the vast amount of craters of various sizes and shapes, as well as challenging conditions such as varying illumination and rugged terrain. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images. We insert trainable parameters using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy with Low-Rank Adaptation, and optimize a combined loss function consisting of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) for localization and a contrastive loss for classification. We achieve satisfactory visual results, along with a maximum recall of 94.0% and a maximum precision of 73.1% on a test dataset from IMPACT.

While this efficiency makes MoE attractive for vision tasks, the patch-based processing in vision models introduces new methods for adversaries to perform backdoor attacks. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of vision MoE models for image classification, specifically the patch-based MoE (pMoE) models and MoE-based vision transformers, against backdoor attacks. We propose a novel routing-aware trigger application method BadPatches, which is designed for patch-based processing in vision MoE models. BadPatches applies triggers on image patches rather than on the entire image. We show that BadPatches achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) with lower poisoning rates than routing-agnostic triggers and is successful at poisoning rates as low as 0.01% with an ASR above 80% on pMoE. Moreover, BadPatches is still effective when an adversary does not have complete knowledge of the patch routing configuration of the considered models. Next, we explore how trigger design affects pMoE patch routing. Finally, we investigate fine-pruning as a defense. Results show that only the fine-tuning stage of fine-pruning removes the backdoor from the model.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM.</p></details> |  | None |

Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels. We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity. We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, We present CLIMP, the first fully Mamba-based contrastive vision-language model that replaces both the vision and text encoders with Mamba. The new architecture encodes sequential structure in both vision and language, with VMamba capturing visual spatial inductive biases, reducing reliance on spurious correlations and producing an embedding space favorable for cross-modal retrieval and out-of-distribution robustness-surpassing OpenAI's CLIP-ViT-B by 7.5% on ImageNet-O. CLIMP naturally supports variable input resolutions without positional encoding interpolation or specialized training, achieving up to 6.6% higher retrieval accuracy at 16x training resolution while using 5x less memory and 1.8x fewer FLOPs. The autoregressive text encoder further overcomes CLIP's fixed context limitation, enabling dense captioning retrieval. Our findings suggest that Mamba exhibits advantageous properties for vision-language learning, making it a compelling alternative to Transformer-based CLIP.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Does DINOv3 Set a New Medical Vision Standard?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06467v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization, such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |
| **[Quantification and Classification of Carbon Nanotubes in Electron Micrographs using Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06673v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Revisiting Residual Connections: Orthogonal Updates for Stable and Efficient Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11881v5)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +3.78 pp top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, maybe final final version</p></details> | None |

Our key finding is that SimCLR pre-training on just 3,000 unlabeled agricultural images provides a +4.57% accuracy improvement--exceeding the +3.70% gain from hierarchical architecture design. Critically, we show this SSL benefit is architecture-agnostic: applying the same pre-training to Swin-Base yields +4.08%, to ViT-Base +4.20%, confirming practitioners should prioritize domain data collection over architectural choices. Using HierarchicalViT (HVT), a Swin-style hierarchical transformer, we evaluate on three datasets: Cotton Leaf Disease (7 classes, 90.24%), PlantVillage (38 classes, 96.3%), and PlantDoc (27 classes, 87.1%). At matched parameter counts, HVT-Base (78M) achieves 88.91% vs. Swin-Base (88M) at 87.23%, a +1.68% improvement. For deployment reliability, we report calibration analysis showing HVT achieves 3.56% ECE (1.52% after temperature scaling).

| **[Performance of a Deep Learning-Based Segmentation Model for Pancreatic Tumors on Public Endoscopic Ultrasound Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05937v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapting Vision Transformers to Ultra-High Resolution Semantic Segmentation with Relay Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05927v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens. The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters. Extensive experiments on three ultra high resolution segmentation benchmarks, Archaeoscape, URUR, and Gleason, and on the conventional Cityscapes dataset show consistent gains, with up to 15 % relative mIoU improvement.

| **[RobustFormer: Noise-Robust Pre-training for images and videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13040v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning-based models like transformers, have revolutionized time-series and vision tasks, they remain highly susceptible to noise and often overfit on noisy patterns rather than robust features. This issue is exacerbated in vision transformers, which rely on pixel-level details that can easily be corrupt. To address this, we leverage the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for its ability to decompose into multi-resolution layers, isolating noise primarily in the high frequency domain while preserving essential low-frequency information for resilient feature learning. Conventional DWT-based methods, however, struggle with computational inefficiencies due to the requirement for a subsequent inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) step. In this work, we introduce RobustFormer, a novel framework that enables noise-robust masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-training for both images and videos by using DWT for efficient downsampling, eliminating the need for expensive IDWT reconstruction and simplifying the attention mechanism to focus on noise-resilient multi-scale representations. To our knowledge, RobustFormer is the first DWT-based method fully compatible with video inputs and MAE-style pre-training. Extensive experiments on noisy image and video datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 8% increase in Top-1 classification accuracy under severe noise conditions in Imagenet-C and up to 2.7% in Imagenet-P standard benchmarks compared to the baseline and up to 13% higher Top-1 accuracy on UCF-101 under severe custom noise perturbations while maintaining similar accuracy scores for clean datasets. We also observe the reduction of computation complexity by up to 4.4% through IDWT removal compared to VideoMAE baseline without any performance drop.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
| **[ViTNT-FIQA: Training-Free Face Image Quality Assessment with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05741v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV Workshops</p></details> | None |
| **[TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

| **[Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content. Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving.

Our results show that ViTs generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers statistically indistinguishable from Geant4 in multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the generation time in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ ms on a single GPU. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on a large dataset and fine-tuning on the target geometry leads to reduced training costs and higher data efficiency, or altogether improves the fidelity of generated showers.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Predictable Gradient Manifolds in Deep Learning: Temporal Path-Length and Intrinsic Rank as a Complexity Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04270v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds. We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation. Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections. Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.</p></details> | 12 Pages.

Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs.

This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Intrinsic Limits of Transformer Image Embeddings in Non-Solvable Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03048v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FCC: Fully Connected Correlation for One-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11917v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment the target object in a query image using only a small set of support images and masks. Therefore, having strong prior information for the target object using the support set is essential for guiding the initial training of FSS, which leads to the success of few-shot segmentation in challenging cases, such as when the target object shows considerable variation in appearance, texture, or scale across the support and query images. Previous methods have tried to obtain prior information by creating correlation maps from pixel-level correlation on final-layer or same-layer features. However, we found these approaches can offer limited and partial information when advanced models like Vision Transformers are used as the backbone. Vision Transformer encoders have a multi-layer structure with identical shapes in their intermediate layers. Leveraging the feature comparison from all layers in the encoder can enhance the performance of few-shot segmentation. We introduce FCC (Fully Connected Correlation) to integrate pixel-level correlations between support and query features, capturing associations that reveal target-specific patterns and correspondences in both same-layers and cross-layers. FCC captures previously inaccessible target information, effectively addressing the limitations of support mask. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL, COCO, and domain shift tests. We conducted an ablation study and cross-layer correlation analysis to validate FCC's core methodology. These findings reveal the effectiveness of FCC in enhancing prior information and overall model performance.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | None |
| **[Diminishing Returns in Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03862v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have become a dominant paradigm in vision and language, but their success is often attributed to large model capacity and massive training data. In this work, we examine how self-supervised pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream fine-tuning interact in a low-capacity regime, using a 5M-parameter Vision Transformer for semantic segmentation. Across multiple data scales, we find that masked image modeling pre-training and downstream fine-tuning reliably improve performance, but with clear diminishing returns as supervision increases. In contrast, inserting an intermediate classification fine-tuning stage consistently degrades downstream performance, with the largest drops occurring precisely where pre-training is most effective. Through an analysis of patch-level representation geometry, we show that classification-based intermediate supervision actively interferes with representations learned during pre-training by collapsing spatial structure critical for dense prediction. These results indicate that, in small models, the geometry of supervision matters more than the number of training stages: misaligned intermediate objectives can negate the benefits of pre-training rather than amplify them.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TAP-ViTs: Task-Adaptive Pruning for On-Device Deployment of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02437v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SLGNet: Synergizing Structural Priors and Language-Guided Modulation for Multimodal Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02249v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception.</p></details> |  | None |

The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main file: 8 pages, 6 figures; supplementary: 3 pages, 2 figures</p></details> | None |

Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a 3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM) framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[HCVP: Leveraging Hierarchical Contrastive Visual Prompt for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09716v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) endeavors to create machine learning models that excel in unseen scenarios by learning invariant features. In DG, the prevalent practice of constraining models to a fixed structure or uniform parameterization to encapsulate invariant features can inadvertently blend specific aspects. Such an approach struggles with nuanced differentiation of inter-domain variations and may exhibit bias towards certain domains, hindering the precise learning of domain-invariant features. Recognizing this, we introduce a novel method designed to supplement the model with domain-level and task-specific characteristics. This approach aims to guide the model in more effectively separating invariant features from specific characteristics, thereby boosting the generalization. Building on the emerging trend of visual prompts in the DG paradigm, our work introduces the novel \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompt (HCVP) methodology. This represents a significant advancement in the field, setting itself apart with a unique generative approach to prompts, alongside an explicit model structure and specialized loss functions. Differing from traditional visual prompts that are often shared across entire datasets, HCVP utilizes a hierarchical prompt generation network enhanced by prompt contrastive learning. These generative prompts are instance-dependent, catering to the unique characteristics inherent to different domains and tasks. Additionally, we devise a prompt modulation network that serves as a bridge, effectively incorporating the generated visual prompts into the vision transformer backbone. Experiments conducted on five DG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HCVP, outperforming both established DG algorithms and adaptation protocols.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The contributions advance ReID research by addressing key limitations in feature learning, domain adaptation, and label noise handling, paving the way for robust deployment in real-world surveillance systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Vi...</summary><p>in Vietnamese language</p></details> | None |
| **[S2M-Net: Spectral-Spatial Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation with Morphology-Aware Adaptive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01285v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation requires balancing local precision for boundary-critical clinical applications, global context for anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency for deployment on limited data and hardware a trilemma that existing architectures fail to resolve. Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models. Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups. Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; 1 figure; letter</p></details> | None |
| **[Quality Detection of Stored Potatoes via Transfer Learning: A CNN and Vision Transformer Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00645v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction. In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660v3)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Late-interaction multimodal retrieval models like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they operate at page-level granularity, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on area efficiency. We evaluate on BBox-DocVQA with ground-truth bounding boxes. For within-page localization (given correct page retrieval), ColQwen3-4B with percentile-50 thresholding achieves 59.7% hit rate at IoU@0.5 (84.4% at IoU@0.25, 35.8% at IoU@0.7), with mean IoU of 0.569, compared to ~6.7% for random region selection. Our approach reduces context tokens by 28.8% compared to returning all OCR regions and by 52.3% compared to full-page image tokens. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training.

However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.

Most AI-generated image detection architectures typically downsample images before inputting them into models, risking the loss of fine-grained details. This paper presents GLASS (Global-Local Attention with Stratified Sampling), an architecture that combines a globally resized view with multiple randomly sampled local crops. These crops are original-resolution regions efficiently selected through spatially stratified sampling and aggregated using attention-based scoring. GLASS can be integrated into vision models to leverage both global and local information in images of any size. Vision Transformer, ResNet, and ConvNeXt models are used as backbones, and experiments show that GLASS outperforms standard transfer learning by achieving higher predictive performance within feasible computational constraints.</p></details> |  | None |

Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 2D Ultrasound (US) scans. Unimodal feature extractors, a 3D DenseNet121-Vision Transformer for MRI and a 2D ResNet50 for US, were selected after systematic comparative analysis. Curated datasets comprising 1,293 MRI and 1,143 US scans were used to train the unimodal models and paired samples of patient-matched MRI-US scans was isolated for multimodal model development and evaluation. On an independent test set, the multimodal fusion model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.5% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.927, outperforming the MRI-only (82.5%, AUC 0.825) and US-only (87.5%, AUC 0.879) models. Integrating MRI and US features provides complementary diagnostic information, demonstrating strong potential to enhance prenatal risk assessment and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CornViT: A Multi-Stage Convolutional Vision Transformer Framework for Hierarchical Corn Kernel Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00897v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate grading of corn kernels is critical for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding, yet it is still predominantly performed by manual inspection. This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

| **[Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation for Pre-Trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24603v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 tables, 3 figures | None |

Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |

We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper introduces Orchid, a novel architecture designed to address the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms without compromising the ability to capture long-range dependencies and in-context learning. At the core of this architecture lies a new data-dependent global convolution layer, which contextually adapts its kernel conditioned on input sequence using a dedicated conditioning neural network. We design two simple conditioning networks that maintain shift equivariance in our data-dependent convolution operation. The dynamic nature of the proposed convolution kernel grants Orchid high expressivity while maintaining quasilinear scalability for long sequences. We evaluate the proposed model across multiple domains, including language modeling and image classification, to highlight its performance and generality. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture not only outperforms traditional attention-based architectures such as BERT and Vision Transformers with smaller model sizes, but also extends the feasible sequence length beyond the limitations of the dense attention layers. This achievement represents a significant step towards more efficient and scalable deep learning models for sequence modeling.

An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain, unfreezing 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and tuning all other layers with LoRA. We then fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 8% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using <10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the-art approaches. Our ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our approach over other baselines such as PEFT.

In addition, we provide error analysis using Grad-CAM visualizations to expose common failure modes and detector biases.

Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23415v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Tuned Vision Transformers Capture Complex Wheat Spike Morphology for Volume Estimation from RGB Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18060v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits such as volume from two-dimensional RGB images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information, projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes using RGB images and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Wheat spike volume is promising for phenotyping as it shows high correlation with spike dry weight, a key component of fruiting efficiency. Accounting for the complex geometry of the spikes, we compare different neural network approaches for volume estimation from 2D images and benchmark them against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Fine-tuned Vision Transformers (DINOv2 and DINOv3) with MLPs achieve the lowest MAPE of 5.08\% and 4.67\% and the highest correlation of 0.96 and 0.97 on six-view indoor images, outperforming fine-tuned CNNs (ResNet18 and ResNet50), wheat-specific backbones, and both baselines. When using frozen DINO backbones, deep-supervised LSTMs outperform MLPs, whereas after fine-tuning, improved high-level representations allow simple MLPs to outperform LSTMs. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume estimation accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods than for deep learning approaches. Fine-tuning DINOv3 on field-based single side-view images yields a MAPE of 8.39\% and a correlation of 0.90, providing a novel pipeline and a fast, accurate, and non-destructive approach for wheat spike volume phenotyping.</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures | None |
| **[Learning Spatial Decay for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09525v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%. Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.</p></details> |  | None |

RETFound is a well-known foundation model developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images, which has shown promising performance in disease diagnosis. Methods: We propose FunduSegmenter, a model integrating a series of novel modules with RETFound, including a Pre-adapter, a Decoder, a Post-adapter, skip connections with Convolutional Block Attention Module and a Vision Transformer block adapter. The model is evaluated on a private dataset, GoDARTS, and four public datasets, IDRiD, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, through internal verification, external verification and domain generalization experiments. Results: An average Dice similarity coefficient of 90.51% was achieved in internal verification, which substantially outperformed the baselines (nnU-Net: 82.91%; DUNet: 89.17%; TransUNet: 87.91%). In all external verification experiments, the average results were about 3% higher than those of the best baseline, and were also competitive in domain generalization. Conclusions: This study explored the potential of the latent general representations learned by RETFound for OD and OC segmentation in fundus camera images. Our FunduSegmenter outperformed nearly all state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed modules are general and can be extended to fine-tuning other foundation models. Translational Relevance: The model shows strong stability and generalization on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, providing stable OD and OC segmentation. This is an essential step for many automated tasks, from setting the accurate retinal coordinate to biomarker discovery.

However, dominant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based solutions are computationally intensive at deployment, and recent lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) and State Space Model (SSM) variants still exhibit substantial complexity. In this paper, we present RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM tailored to radar HAR under on-sensor compute, latency, and energy constraints typical of distributed radar systems. RadMamba combines (i) channel fusion with downsampling, (ii) Doppler-aligned segmentation that preserves the physical continuity of Doppler over time, and (iii) convolutional token projections that better capture Doppler-span variations, thereby retaining temporal-Doppler structure while reducing the number of Floating-point Operations per Inference (#FLOP/Inf.). Evaluated across three datasets with different radars and types of activities, RadMamba matches the prior best 99.8% accuracy of a recent SSM-based model on the Continuous Wave (CW) radar dataset, while requiring only 1/400 of its parameters. On a dataset of non-continuous activities with Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, RadMamba remains competitive with leading 92.0% results using about 1/10 of the parameters, and on a continuous FMCW radar dataset it surpasses methods with far more parameters by at least 3%, using only 6.7k parameters.

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/AlevLab-dev/BertsWinMAE and https://github.com/AlevLab-dev/GCond.

However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> | None |

For example, ViT-Base pre-trained on ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M showed 83.0 and 84.1% top-1 accuracy when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, and FDSL showed 83.8% top-1 accuracy when pre-trained under comparable conditions (hyperparameters and number of epochs). Especially, the ExFractalDB-21k pre-training was calculated with x14.2 fewer images compared with JFT-300M. Images generated by formulas avoid privacy and copyright issues, labeling costs and errors, and biases that real images suffer from, and thus have tremendous potential for pre-training general models. To understand the performance of the synthetic images, we tested two hypotheses, namely (i) object contours are what matter in FDSL datasets and (ii) an increased number of parameters for label creation improves performance in FDSL pre-training. To test the former hypothesis, we constructed a dataset that consisted of simple object contour combinations. We found that this dataset matched the performance of fractal databases. For the latter hypothesis, we found that increasing the difficulty of the pre-training task generally leads to better fine-tuning accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Vision Transformers are Circulant Attention Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21542v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

However, these models suffer from a critical limitation: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three representative PDE systems, including Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity demanded by practical scientific applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral | None |

This study presents a hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model integrates the global contextual reasoning of a Swin Transformer with the local fine-grained feature extraction of a Vision Transformer. The student network was implemented as a compact Tiny-ViT structure that inherits the teacher's semantic and morphological knowledge via soft-label distillation, achieving a balance between efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Two carefully curated Wireless Capsule Endoscopy datasets, encompassing major GI disease classes, were employed to ensure balanced representation and prevent inter-sample bias. The proposed framework achieved remarkable performance with accuracies of 0.9978 and 0.9928 on Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively, and an average AUC of 1.0000, signifying near-perfect discriminative capability. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM, LIME, and Score-CAM confirmed that the model's predictions were grounded in clinically significant tissue regions and pathologically relevant morphological cues, validating the framework's transparency and reliability. The Tiny-ViT demonstrated diagnostic performance with reduced computational complexity comparable to its transformer-based teacher while delivering faster inference, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Overall, the proposed framework provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for AI-assisted GI disease diagnosis, paving the way toward future intelligent endoscopic screening that is compatible with clinical practicality.</p></details> |  | None |

Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures | None |

Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.</p></details> | 7 tables; 11 figures | None |

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.</p></details> |  | None |

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UbiQVision: Quantifying Uncertainty in XAI for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20288v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HEART-VIT: Hessian-Guided Efficient Dynamic Attention and Token Pruning in Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20120v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.</p></details> |  | None |

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

| **[Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Neural Decoding of Overt Speech from ECoG Using Vision Transformers and Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04618v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond CLIP: Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Transformers for Cross-Modal Alignment in Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19663v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures | None |

We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TCFormer: A 5M-Parameter Transformer with Density-Guided Aggregation for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22203v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IPCV: Information-Preserving Compression for MLLM Visual Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18747v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver strong vision-language performance but at high computational cost, driven by numerous visual tokens processed by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder. Existing token pruning strategies are inadequate: LLM-stage token pruning overlooks the ViT's overhead, while conventional ViT token pruning, without language guidance, risks discarding textually critical visual cues and introduces feature distortions amplified by the ViT's bidirectional attention. To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 20206, Project website: geovit-aaai26.github.io</p></details> | None |

To overcome this challenge, a hybrid 3D deep learning model for automated PAS detection from volumetric MRI scans is proposed in this study. The model integrates a 3D DenseNet121 to capture local features and a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) to model global spatial context. It was developed and evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 1,133 MRI volumes. Multiple 3D deep learning architectures were also evaluated for comparison. On an independent test set, the DenseNet121-ViT model achieved the highest performance with a five-run average accuracy of 84.3%. These results highlight the strength of hybrid CNN-Transformer models as a computer-aided diagnosis tool. The model's performance demonstrates a clear potential to assist radiologists by providing a robust decision support to improve diagnostic consistency across interpretations, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and timeliness of PAS diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

Current wound assessment remains predominantly subjective, leading to inconsistent classification and delayed interventions. We present WoundNet-Ensemble, an Internet of Medical Things system leveraging a novel ensemble of three complementary deep learning architectures: ResNet-50, the self-supervised Vision Transformer DINOv2, and Swin Transformer, for automated classification of six clinically distinct wound types. Our system achieves 99.90 percent ensemble accuracy on a comprehensive dataset of 5,175 wound images spanning diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, thermal burns, pilonidal sinus wounds, and fungating malignant tumors. The weighted fusion strategy demonstrates a 3.7 percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we implement a longitudinal wound healing tracker that computes healing rates, severity scores, and generates clinical alerts. This work demonstrates a robust, accurate, and clinically deployable tool for modernizing wound care through artificial intelligence, addressing critical needs in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.

However, previous well-established DNNs, despite being able to maintain superior accuracy, have also been evolving to be deeper and wider and thus inevitably necessitate prohibitive computational resources for both training and inference. This trend further enlarges the computational gap between computation-intensive DNNs and resource-constrained embedded computing systems, making it challenging to deploy powerful DNNs upon real-world embedded computing systems towards ubiquitous embedded intelligence. To alleviate the above computational gap and enable ubiquitous embedded intelligence, we, in this survey, focus on discussing recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems, spanning from training to inference, from manual to automated, from convolutional neural networks to transformers, from transformers to vision transformers, from vision models to large language models, from software to hardware, and from algorithms to applications. Specifically, we discuss recent efficient deep learning infrastructures for embedded computing systems from the lens of (1) efficient manual network design for embedded computing systems, (2) efficient automated network design for embedded computing systems, (3) efficient network compression for embedded computing systems, (4) efficient on-device learning for embedded computing systems, (5) efficient large language models for embedded computing systems, (6) efficient deep learning software and hardware for embedded computing systems, and (7) efficient intelligent applications for embedded computing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) 2024</p></details> | None |

Conversely, recent diffusion-based approaches (e.g., Consec. BB) achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality but suffer from prohibitive latency, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster, proving that semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods. Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Asilomar Conference</p></details> | None |

Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated ``Perception-Creation-Evaluation'' pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose \textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying subtle forgery-related features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI2026 | None |

With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.</p></details> |  | None |

However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://simongiebenhain.github.io/Pix2NPHM/ , Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgpEJC5p1Ts</p></details> | [Code Link](https://simongiebenhain.github.io/Pix2NPHM) |

Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions.

Beyond algorithmic development, a key limitation in advancing VAD research is the lack of large-scale, systematically controlled, and publicly available datasets. To address this, we introduce LibriVAD - a scalable open-source dataset derived from LibriSpeech and augmented with diverse real-world and synthetic noise sources. LibriVAD enables systematic control over speech-to-noise ratio, silence-to-speech ratio (SSR), and noise diversity, and is released in three sizes (15 GB, 150 GB, and 1.5 TB) with two variants (LibriVAD-NonConcat and LibriVAD-Concat) to support different experimental setups. We benchmark multiple feature-model combinations, including waveform, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Gammatone filter bank cepstral coefficients, and introduce the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for VAD. Our experiments show that ViT with MFCC features consistently outperforms established VAD models such as boosted deep neural network and convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network across seen, unseen, and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, including evaluation on the real-world VOiCES dataset. We further analyze the impact of dataset size and SSR on model generalization, experimentally showing that scaling up dataset size and balancing SSR noticeably and consistently enhance VAD performance under OOD conditions. All datasets, trained models, and code are publicly released to foster reproducibility and accelerate progress in VAD research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we employ the TransUNet architecture, a hybrid framework that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net structure. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution. We trained the model on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset using a robust augmentation pipeline and a hybrid loss function to mitigate class imbalance. On the internal validation set, the model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (F1-score) of 0.8886 using an optimized threshold of 0.4843. Crucially, to assess generalizability, we performed external validation on two independent datasets: the AZH Wound Care Center dataset (n=278) and the Medetec dataset (n=152). Without any retraining, the model achieved Dice scores of 0.6209 and 0.7850, respectively, demonstrating robust zero-shot transferability to unseen clinical domains. Furthermore, clinical utility analysis revealed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.9749) between predicted and ground-truth wound areas. These outcomes demonstrate that our approach effectively integrates global and local feature extraction, offering a reliable, effective, and explainable solution for automated foot ulcer assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans. We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Radiology Report Generation with Layer-Wise Anatomical Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16841v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> | None |
| **[Sparse-Tuning: Adapting Vision Transformers with Efficient Fine-tuning and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14700v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular solution for adapting pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models to downstream applications by updating only a small subset of parameters. While current PEFT methods have achieved fine-tuning efficiency, they overlook the efficiency of computation and GPU memory during inference, falling short of practical requirements. To address this limitation, we propose Sparse-Tuning, an efficient and effective framework that leverages popular token sparsification (TS) techniques to reduce information redundancy in images and videos, thereby significantly improving computational and memory efficiency. However, TS often compromises performance due to inevitable information loss. To address this limitation, we further introduce Dense Adapters (DA) to compensate for the information losses incurred by token sparsification. DA integrates comprehensive token information from shallow layers into the retained tokens of deeper layers, ensuring minimal performance degradation. Through the integration of TS techniques and DA, Sparse-Tuning achieves a significant reduction in computation and memory overhead while maintaining performance. Empirical results on VTAB-1K, three image datasets, and two video datasets show that Sparse-Tuning reduces GFLOPs to 66\% of the original ViT-B while achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to full fine-tuning and other PEFT baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-localization on a 3D map by fusing global and local features from a monocular camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26170v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets. Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[VAAS: Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring for Image Manipulation Detection in Digital Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15512v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GenAI-enabled Residual Motion Estimation for Energy-Efficient Semantic Video Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15481v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication addresses the limitations of the Shannon paradigm by focusing on transmitting meaning rather than exact representations, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption. This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper for ECIR 2026</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a new facial landmark detector based on vision transformers, which consists of two unique designs: Dual Vision Transformer (D-ViT) and Long Skip Connections (LSC). Based on the observation that the channel dimension of feature maps essentially represents the linear bases of the heatmap space, we propose learning the interconnections between these linear bases to model the inherent geometric relations among landmarks via Channel-split ViT. We integrate such channel-split ViT into the standard vision transformer (i.e., spatial-split ViT), forming our Dual Vision Transformer to constitute the prediction blocks. We also suggest using long skip connections to deliver low-level image features to all prediction blocks, thereby preventing useful information from being discarded by intermediate supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposal on the widely used benchmarks, i.e., WFLW, COFW, and 300W, demonstrating that our model outperforms the previous SOTAs across all three benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025.

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models including a Vision Transformer under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V2 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations in this study confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kiranshahi/pneumonia-analysis) |

While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report of Xiaomi HyperAI Team</p></details> | None |

Despite their impressive performance, ViTs exhibit notable vulnerability to evasion attacks, necessitating the development of specialized Adversarial Training (AT) strategies tailored to their unique architecture. While a direct solution might involve applying existing AT methods to ViTs, our analysis reveals significant incompatibilities, particularly with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches such as Generalist (CVPR 2023) and DBAT (USENIX Security 2024). This paper presents a systematic investigation of adversarial robustness in ViTs and provides a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained via derived MI bounds. Building on this insight, we propose a self-supervised AT method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate adversarial pre-training by masked image modeling with autoencoders. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that MIMIR can consistently provide improved natural and robust accuracy, where MIMIR outperforms SOTA AT results on ImageNet-1K. Notably, MIMIR demonstrates superior robustness against unforeseen attacks and common corruption data and can also withstand adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses full knowledge of the defense mechanism.

While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables, under review at MIDL 2026</p></details> | None |

Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets.

| **[ALERT Open Dataset and Input-Size-Agnostic Vision Transformer for Driver Activity Recognition using IR-UWB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12206v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions. This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Histopathologic Assessment of Hirschsprung Disease Using a Multi-Stage Vision Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20734v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, the correct identification of ganglion cells is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage analysis framework that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework, based on a Vision Transformer model (ViT-B/16), sequentially segments the muscularis propria, segments the myenteric plexus, and detects ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For ganglion cells annotated with high certainty, the model achieved 62.1\% precision and 89.1% recall. When considering all annotated ganglion cells, regardless of certainty level, the overall precision was 67.0%. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, blockchain platforms remain vulnerable to a broad range of cyberattacks, particularly those aimed at exploiting transactions and smart contracts (SCs) to steal digital assets or compromise system integrity. To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective framework for detecting cyberattacks within blockchain systems. Our framework begins with a preprocessing tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform key features of blockchain transactions into image representations. These images are then analyzed through vision-based analysis using Vision Transformers (ViT), a recent advancement in computer vision known for its superior ability to capture complex patterns and semantic relationships. By integrating NLP-based preprocessing with vision-based learning, our framework can detect a wide variety of attack types. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy (achieving 99.5%) and robustness in cyberattack detection for blockchain transactions and SCs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Do We Need Reformer for Vision? An Experimental Comparison with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11260v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings. In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences. While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.</p></details> |  | None |

While this approach is useful in many cases, it necessarily flattens the complexity and nuance present in real communication systems. chatter is a new Python library for analyzing animal communication in continuous latent space using information theory and modern machine learning techniques. It is taxonomically agnostic, and has been tested with the vocalizations of birds, bats, whales, and primates. By leveraging a variety of different architectures, including variational autoencoders and vision transformers, chatter represents vocal sequences as trajectories in high-dimensional latent space, bypassing the need for manual or automatic categorization of units. The library provides an end-to-end workflow -- from preprocessing and segmentation to model training and feature extraction -- that enables researchers to quantify the complexity, predictability, similarity, and novelty of vocal sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters. HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks. HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics.

This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen architectures spanning convolutional, hybrid, and transformer families for subclinical keratoconus detection from three-dimensional anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The results demonstrate that hierarchical architectures achieve 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the difficult subclinical regime, outperforming both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and global-attention Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. Mechanistic analyses indicate that this advantage arises from spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate extent of subclinical abnormalities, avoiding the excessive locality observed in convolutional models and the diffuse integration characteristic of pure global attention. Attention-distance measurements show that subclinical cases require longer spatial integration than healthy or overtly pathological volumes, with hierarchical models exhibiting lower variance and more anatomically coherent focus. Representational similarity further indicates that hierarchical attention learns a distinct feature space that balances local structure sensitivity with flexible long-range interactions. Auxiliary age and sex prediction tasks demonstrate moderately high cross-task consistency, supporting the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for volumetric anomaly detection and highlight hierarchical attention as a principled approach for early pathological change analysis in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of "apparent rotation", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware. On the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, our end-to-end pipeline achieves a latency of ~75 ms per frame under sequential execution, and a non-blocking throughput of up to 33 FPS when stages are scheduled concurrently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

In this work, we introduce GLaD, a geometry-aware VLA framework that incorporates 3D geometric priors during pretraining through knowledge distillation. Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline.

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Common approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.9% in final validation accuracy and 20.9% in convergence speed. By replacing randomness with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable foundation for Deep Learning systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices. We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters. On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes. These results show the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Contributions include: (1) Developed an ETAS framework on the SKINCON dataset to optimize a Vision Transformer (ViT) tailored for dermatological feature representation and then fine-tuned binary classifiers for each of the 23 skin disease categories in the DermNet dataset to enhance classification performance; (2) Designed a StackNet architecture that integrates multiple fine-tuned binary ViT classifiers to enhance predictive robustness and mitigate class imbalance issues; (3) Implemented a RAG pipeline, termed Diagnostic Explanation and Retrieval Model for Dermatology, which harnesses the capabilities of the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM architecture to generate personalized, contextually informed diagnostic descriptions and explanations for patients, leveraging a repository of verified dermatological materials; (4) Performed extensive experimental evaluations on 23 skin disease categories to demonstrate performance increase, achieving an overall F1-score of 56.30% that surpasses SkinGPT-4 (48.51%) by a considerable margin, representing a performance increase of 16.06%; (5) Conducted a domain-expert evaluation, with eight licensed medical doctors, of the clinical responses generated by our AI assistant for seven dermatological conditions. Our results show a 92% agreement rate with the assessments provided by our AI assistant (6) Created a proof-of-concept prototype that fully integrates our DermETAS-SNA LLM into our AI assistant to demonstrate its practical feasibility for real-world clinical and educational applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Oscillations Make Neural Networks Robust to Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00490v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We challenge the prevailing view that weight oscillations observed during Quantization Aware Training (QAT) are merely undesirable side-effects and argue instead that they are an essential part of QAT. We show in a univariate linear model that QAT results in an additional loss term that causes oscillations by pushing weights away from their nearest quantization level. Based on the mechanism from the analysis, we then derive a regularizer that induces oscillations in the weights of neural networks during training. Our empirical results on ResNet-18 and Tiny Vision Transformer, evaluated on CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets, demonstrate across a range of quantization levels that training with oscillations followed by post-training quantization (PTQ) is sufficient to recover the performance of QAT in most cases. With this work we provide further insight into the dynamics of QAT and contribute a novel insight into explaining the role of oscillations in QAT which until now have been considered to have a primarily negative effect on quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR, 2025).

| **[The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.
