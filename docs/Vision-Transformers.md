| **[MMDEW: Multipurpose Multiclass Density Estimation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02213v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+1 p...</summary><p>8+1 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards fairer public transit: Real-time tensor-based multimodal fare evasion and fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02165v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces a multimodal system designed to detect fraud and fare evasion in public transportation by analyzing closed circuit television (CCTV) and audio data. The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g., tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds). The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |
| **[VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02086v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries. In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details. This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ClustViT: Clustering-based Token Merging for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01948v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | Submitted to IEEE | None |
| **[SLAP: Learning Speaker and Health-Related Representations from Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01860v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech encodes paralinguistic information such as demographics, voice quality, and health. Yet no audio foundation model supports zero-shot or out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to these tasks. We introduce SLAP (Speaker contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining), the first model aligning speech with natural language descriptions of speaker and health metadata through contrastive learning. SLAP combines a Vision Transformer audio encoder with text encoders, trained on more than 3400 hours across 9 datasets with diverse speaker annotations. We evaluated on 38 binary classification tasks spanning demographics, voice characteristics, and clinical assessments across 14 datasets in 7 languages. SLAP achieves 62.9% average F1 in zero-shot evaluation, a 48% relative improvement over CLAP (42.4%), while demonstrating strong OOD generalization to unseen languages and clinical populations. When fine-tuned with linear probing, SLAP reaches 69.3% F1 overall and achieves best-in-class performance on health tasks (57.9% F1), surpassing larger foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ENLighten: Lighten the Transformer, Enable Efficient Optical Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01673v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photonic computing has emerged as a promising substrate for accelerating the dense linear-algebra operations at the heart of AI, yet adoption for large Transformer models remains in its infancy. We identify two bottlenecks: (1) costly electro--optic conversions and data-movement overheads that erode energy efficiency as model sizes scale; (2) a mismatch between limited on-chip photonic resources and Transformer scale, which forces frequent reuse of photonic tensor cores and dilutes throughput gains. To address these challenges, we introduce a hardware--software co-design framework. First, we propose \texttt{Lighten}, a PTC-aware compression flow that post-hoc decomposes each Transformer weight matrix into a low-rank component plus a structured-sparse component aligned to photonic tensor-core granularity, without lengthy retraining. Second, we present \texttt{ENLighten}, a reconfigurable photonic accelerator with dynamically adaptive tensor cores, driven by broadband light redistribution, enabling fine-grained sparsity support and full power gating of inactive parts. On ImageNet, \texttt{Lighten} prunes a Base-scale Vision Transformer by 50\% with $\approx$1\% accuracy drop after only 3 epochs (about 1 hour) of fine-tuning. Deployed on \texttt{ENLighten}, it achieves a $2.5\times$ improvement in energy--delay product over the state-of-the-art photonic Transformer accelerator.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 page version is accepted by ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> | None |

These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the article to appear in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.

| **[DEAP DIVE: Dataset Investigation with Vision transformers for EEG evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00725v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex, resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4 quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points (also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can be found here: https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/aifb/ATKS/public/AutoSMiLeS/DEAP-DIVE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ABAW Workshop at ICCV2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Cutting the Skip: Training Residual-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00345v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Token Probes: Hallucination Detection via Activation Tensors with ACT-ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00296v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

| **[GastroViT: A Vision Transformer Based Ensemble Learning Approach for Gastrointestinal Disease Classification with Grad CAM & SHAP Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26502v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs, attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662 images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million (M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%, 87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability, providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A quantitative analysis of semantic information in deep representations of text and images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AttriGen: Automated Multi-Attribute Annotation for Blood Cell Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26185v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Stochastic Layer-wise Learning: Scalable and Efficient Alternative to Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05181v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation underpins modern deep learning, yet its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and incurs high memory costs. In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Causally Guided Gaussian Perturbations for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26027v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning an Ensemble Token from Task-driven Priors in Facial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01290v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level. Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the feature representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 8figures, 4tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Transformers through the lens of support-preserving maps between measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25611v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AttentionViG: Cross-Attention-Based Dynamic Neighbor Aggregation in Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25570v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV submission. 13 pages, including the main text (8 pages), references, and supplementary material</p></details> | None |

Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1 accuracy drop.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Better Generalization via Distributional Input Projection Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04690v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this, we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance. Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

We identify \emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense.</p></details> |  | None |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MIAFEx: An Attention-based Feature Extraction Method for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08562v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

We present a continual learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at 0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving.

Existing methods, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details. Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI systems for subjective visual assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction, dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Though previous VLP works have proved the effectiveness of ViTs, they still suffer from computational efficiency brought by the long visual sequence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model with \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mage \textbf{P}atch \textbf{S}election, namely TRIPS, which reduces the visual sequence progressively with a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone for efficient training and inference. The patch-selection layer can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify the attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, TRIPS does not introduce extra parameters to ViTs. Experimental results on a variety of popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TRIPS gain a speedup of 40\% over previous similar VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2022</p></details> | None |

However, current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM) method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically, the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner, STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional Mamba architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse degradations, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations. First, QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026.

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, revised version</p></details> | None |
| **[Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures | None |

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%. Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.</p></details> |  | None |

These scenarios commonly operate under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution, particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being 10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques.

These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training. In this work, we describe a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics: we identify two novel \textit{dynamical} scaling laws that govern how performance evolves as function of different norm-based complexity measures. Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a single-layer perceptron trained with logistic loss, where we derive the new dynamical scaling laws, and we explain them through the implicit bias induced by gradient-based training.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 20 Figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.</p></details> |  | None |

MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size, resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 algorithms, 1 table, conference paper</p></details> | None |
| **[VLCE: A Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Image Description in Disaster Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21609v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> | None |

We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures | None |

Drawing on this neuroscientific inspiration, we investigate the effect of introducing patches from different spatial frequencies into Vision Transformers (ViTs). We name this model Retina Vision Transformer (RetinaViT) due to its inspiration from the human visual system. Our experiments on benchmark data show that RetinaViT exhibits a strong tendency to attend to low spatial frequency components in the early layers, and shifts its attention to high spatial frequency components as the network goes deeper. This tendency emerged by itself without any additional inductive bias, and aligns with the visual processing order of the human visual system. We hypothesise that RetinaViT captures structural features, or the gist of the scene, in earlier layers, before attending to fine details in subsequent layers, which is the reverse of the processing order of mainstream backbone vision models, such as CNNs. We also observe that RetinaViT is more robust to significant reductions in model size compared to the original ViT, which we hypothesise to have come from its ability to capture the gist of the scene early.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by injecting them into the Action Expert. RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic intelligence.

Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Sensors + Imaging; presented on 17th of September (Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications III)</p></details> | None |

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 12 pages (including 3 pages of references), 6 figures, 6 tables.

Therefore, building efficient and general-purpose visual backbones based on SSMs is a promising direction. Compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM) methods is not yet fully competitive. To enable SSMs to process image data, ViMs typically flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, inevitably ignoring some 2D local dependencies, thereby weakening the model's ability to interpret spatial relationships from a global perspective. We use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the spectrum of the feature map and add it to the original feature map, enabling ViM to model a unified visual representation in both frequency and spatial domains. The introduction of frequency domain information enables ViM to have a global receptive field during scanning. We propose a novel model called Vim-F, which employs pure Mamba encoders and scans in both the frequency and spatial domains. Moreover, we question the necessity of position embedding in ViM and remove it accordingly in Vim-F, which helps to fully utilize the efficient long-sequence modeling capability of ViM. Finally, we redesign a patch embedding for Vim-F, leveraging a convolutional stem to capture more local correlations, further improving the performance of Vim-F.

| **[Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20939v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 7 tables, code is available at https://github.com/tiny-smart/tasselnetv4</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/tiny-smart/tasselnetv4) |

We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports, LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations. These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants.

This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, minor typo fix, not final version, Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a more serious challenge. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. Additionally, we propose a scheme to predict task identity with confidence and calibrate the model's outputs accordingly. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and computation efficiency in training over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | Latest reversion | None |

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weakly Supervised Food Image Segmentation using Vision Transformers and Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19028v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> | None |
| **[No Labels Needed: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Collaborative Self-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18938v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Lightweight Vision Transformer with Window and Spatial Attention for Food Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18692v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |

Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to WACV 2026 application track, model weights available at: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/PulmonaryEmbolismSegmentation</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/PulmonaryEmbolismSegmentation) |
| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha) |

These models are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains - particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks - remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner, specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE (Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance. GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation.

This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models. Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures | None |

Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the \textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba (Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for complex visual assessment tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels. We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity. We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability.

This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.</p></details> | - | None |

Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms in AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise.

An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages, XAI 2025 | None |
| **[Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15058v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL) framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack. This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were found and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages article, 29 pdf pages, 19 figures, MLRC.

| **[Fast Multipole Attention: A Scalable Multilevel Attention Mechanism for Text and Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11960v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformer networks benefit from a global receptive field, their quadratic cost relative to sequence length restricts their application to long sequences and high-resolution inputs. We introduce Fast Multipole Attention (FMA), a divide-and-conquer mechanism for self-attention inspired by the Fast Multipole Method from n-body physics. FMA reduces the time and memory complexity of self-attention from $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ while preserving full-context interactions. FMA contains a learned hierarchy with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ levels of resolution. In this hierarchy, nearby tokens interact at full resolution, while distant tokens engage through progressively coarser, learned basis functions. We have developed both 1D and 2D implementations of FMA for language and vision tasks, respectively. On autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling benchmarks, the 1D variant either matches or outperforms leading efficient attention baselines with substantially lower memory use. With linear complexity, the 2D variant demonstrates superior performance over strong vision transformer baselines in classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our results confirm that the multilevel attention implemented by FMA allows Transformer-based models to scale to much longer sequences and higher-resolution inputs without loss in accuracy. This provides a principled, physics-inspired approach for developing scalable neural networks suitable for language, vision, and multimodal tasks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/epoch98/FMA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/epoch98/FMA) |
| **[Where Do Tokens Go? Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to 1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the final encoder layer.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations.

This paper introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted at IEEE INDISCON 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13255v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce \textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA (\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++ consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of +0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures | None |

While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rome, Italy 2025</p></details> | None |

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition.

The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required.

Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this setting, federated training happens after a stable point has been reached through conventional training. Global model weights are first centrally pretrained by the server on a public dataset following which only the last few linear layers (the classification head) of the model are finetuned across clients. In this scenario, existing data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) in FL show two key weaknesses. First, strongly input-correlated gradient information from the initial model layers is never shared, significantly degrading reconstruction accuracy. Second, DRAs in which the server makes highly specific, handcrafted manipulations to the model structure or parameters (for e.g., layers with all zero weights, identity mappings and rows with identical weight patterns) are easily detectable by an active client. Improving on these, we propose MAUI, a stealthy DRA that does not require any overt manipulations to the model architecture or weights, and relies solely on the gradients of the classification head. MAUI first extracts "robust" feature representations of the input batch from the gradients of the classification head and subsequently inverts these representations to the original inputs. We report highly accurate reconstructions on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets on a variety of model architectures including convolution networks (CNN, VGG11), ResNets (18, 50), ShuffleNet-V2 and Vision Transformer (ViT B-32), regardless of the batch size. MAUI significantly outperforms prior DRAs in reconstruction quality, achieving 40-120% higher PSNR scores.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility.

To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</p></details> |  | None |

A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Differential privacy offers principled protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds, which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds only the difference between the required noise and what has already been accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal, and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP). PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions, PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80% with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

Speculum-free devices that integrate imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913 frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm 0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches. External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both high- and low-resource contexts.</p></details> | 2 pages | None |
| **[I-Segmenter: Integer-Only Vision Transformer for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10334v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling, ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably, even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath) method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers, improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to baseline and linear DropPath schedules.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 tables | None |

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> | None |

Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary Information will be provided with the published manuscript</p></details> | None |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third (tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert decision-making in forensic age estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, Scientific Reports</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</p></details> |  | None |

To balance computation efficiency and performance in downstream vision tasks, we propose an efficient ViT model with sparse attention (dubbed SAEViT) and convolution blocks. Specifically, a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module has been proposed to perform adaptive sparse sampling and recover the feature map via deconvolution operation,} which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, which mitigates the redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FFN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for fundamental vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.</p></details> |  | None |

In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.</p></details> |  | None |

Although histopathologic examination remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature. Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a 2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision.

In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

Leveraging additional modalities (X-modality) like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB provides complementary information, enabling more robust and reliable prediction. In this work, we introduce Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation utilizing the advanced Mamba. Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs, with their limited local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which offer global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic complexity, our model achieves global receptive fields with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder and innovating a Mamba-based fusion mechanism, we effectively select essential information from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhance the channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our proposed method is rigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application of State Space Models (SSMs) in multi-modal perception tasks.

However, their global modeling often comes with substantial computational overhead, in stark contrast to the human eye's efficient information processing. Inspired by the human eye's sparse scanning mechanism, we propose a \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention mechanism ($\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$). This mechanism predefines a series of Anchors of Interest for each token and employs local attention to efficiently model the spatial information around these anchors, avoiding redundant global modeling and excessive focus on local information.

Building on $\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$, we introduce the \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{Vi}sion \textbf{T}ransformer (SSViT). Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of SSViT across a variety of tasks. Specifically, on ImageNet classification, without additional supervision or training data, SSViT achieves top-1 accuracies of \textbf{84.4\%/85.7\%} with \textbf{4.4G/18.2G} FLOPs.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy, 99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0% accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%, outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment in real-world clinical screening systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

These models typically rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which process video frames individually to extract visual embeddings. However, generating embeddings for large-scale videos requires ViT inferencing across numerous frames, posing a major hurdle to real-world deployment and necessitating solutions for integration into scalable video data management systems. This paper introduces D\'ej\`a Vu, a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is ReuseViT, a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this, D\'ej\`a Vu integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains. Evaluations on three VideoLM tasks show that D\'ej\`a Vu accelerates embedding generation by up to a 2.64x within a 2% error bound, dramatically enhancing the practicality of VideoLMs for large-scale video analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 VLDB</p></details> | None |

Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, codes: https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KimiakiShirahama/FeatureSpaceAnalysisByGuidedDiffusionModel) |

By pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional KD methods often treat all image patches uniformly, overlooking spatial variations in learning difficulty. To address this limitation, we propose SPACE-iT, a novel framework for Spatial-Aware Curriculum Exploration via Feedback-Driven Adaptive Augmentation. At its core, SPACE-iT computes spatial confidence scores at the attention, patch, and logit levels. This confidence map supports a two-fold strategy: (1) dynamically modulating the distillation loss, and (2) guiding an adaptive augmentation module that intensifies reverse curriculum learning. By establishing a feedback-driven reverse curriculum that initially exposes students to challenging regions-progressing from hard to easy-SPACE-iT enables more effective learning of complex spatial patterns and achieves superior performance over vanilla distillation, without introducing additional memory overhead.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |
| **[A Decade of Wheat Mapping for Lebanon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11366v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wheat accounts for approximately 20% of the world's caloric intake, making it a vital component of global food security. Given this importance, mapping wheat fields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy makers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions regarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of satellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat segmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of wheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing pipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed pipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as the clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By merging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method produces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to perform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level precision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational agricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate mapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical studies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GCRPNet: Graph-Enhanced Contextual and Regional Perception Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10542v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Deep Learning-based Forward Solvers for Brain Tumor Growth Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08226v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor, poses major challenges due to its poor prognosis and high morbidity rates. Partial differential equation-based models offer promising potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes by simulating patient-specific tumor behavior for improved radiotherapy planning. However, model calibration remains a bottleneck due to the high computational demands of optimization methods like Monte Carlo sampling and evolutionary algorithms. To address this, we recently introduced an approach leveraging a neural forward solver with gradient-based optimization to significantly reduce calibration time. This approach requires a highly accurate and fully differentiable forward model. We investigate multiple architectures, including (i) an enhanced TumorSurrogate, (ii) a modified nnU-Net, and (iii) a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT). The nnU-Net achieved the best overall results, excelling in both tumor outline matching and voxel-level prediction of tumor cell concentration. It yielded the lowest MSE in tumor cell concentration compared to ground truth numerical simulation and the highest Dice score across all tumor cell concentration thresholds. Our study demonstrates significant enhancement in forward solver performance and outlines important future research directions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation. Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness for small, low-contrast lesions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this, so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised approaches. Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data, thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time.

While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures. However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 4 Figures | None |

This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring (ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50, II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed 3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227 validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model, ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits, reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL, with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs, high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL. Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$ and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization, such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

An active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging, especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels, and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Accepted at ECAI 2025 (28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification; however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters, restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> | None |

Two key physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function: skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly, diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens. However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression. Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by the journal of Machine Intelligence Research (JCR-Q1).

Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers 6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful clinical utility.</p></details> |  | None |

The series of models that employ our methodology are collectively known as Noisy Neural Networks (NoisyNN), with examples such as NoisyViT and NoisyCNN. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this work shows noise can be an effective way to change the entropy of the learning system. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep models under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the task complexity. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of 95$\%$ on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise, can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.</p></details> | <details><summary>Task ...</summary><p>Task Entropy, ViT, CNN</p></details> | None |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters.

| **[Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</p></details> |  | None |

Motion artifacts in brain MRI, mainly from rigid head motion, degrade image quality and hinder downstream applications. Conventional methods to mitigate these artifacts, including repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, impose workflow burdens. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for MRI motion artifact correction.Approach.Res-MoCoDiff exploits a novel residual error shifting mechanism during the forward diffusion process to incorporate information from motion-corrupted images. This mechanism allows the model to simulate the evolution of noise with a probability distribution closely matching that of the corrupted data, enabling a reverse diffusion process that requires only four steps. The model employs a U-net backbone, with attention layers replaced by Swin Transformer blocks, to enhance robustness across resolutions. Furthermore, the training process integrates a combined l1+l2 loss function, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on both an in-silico dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and an in-vivo MR-ART dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and a diffusion model with a vision transformer backbone, using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE.Main results. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across minor, moderate, and heavy distortion levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Transferable Mask Transformer: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present a novel deep learning framework that leverages the diagnostic value of 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging for automated glaucoma detection. In this framework, we integrate a pre-trained Vision Transformer on retinal data for rich slice-wise feature extraction and a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for capturing inter-slice spatial dependencies. This dual-component approach enables comprehensive analysis of local nuances and global structural integrity, crucial for accurate glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art ones, achieving an F1-score of 93.01%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 69.33%, and AUC of 94.20%. The framework's ability to leverage the valuable information in 3D OCT data holds significant potential for enhancing clinical decision support systems and improving patient outcomes in glaucoma management.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detecting Regional Spurious Correlations in Vision Transformers via Token Discarding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04009v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Diffusion Models with Fixed-Size Reusable Structures for On-Device Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06119v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers and U-Net architectures have been widely adopted in the implementation of Diffusion Models. However, each architecture presents specific challenges while realizing them on-device. Vision Transformers require positional embedding to maintain correspondence between the tokens processed by the transformer, although they offer the advantage of using fixed-size, reusable repetitive blocks following tokenization. The U-Net architecture lacks these attributes, as it utilizes variable-sized intermediate blocks for down-convolution and up-convolution in the noise estimation backbone for the diffusion process. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that utilizes a fixed-size, reusable transformer block as a core structure, making it more suitable for hardware implementation. Our architecture is characterized by low complexity, token-free design, absence of positional embeddings, uniformity, and scalability, making it highly suitable for deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices. The proposed model exhibit competitive and consistent performance across both unconditional and conditional image generation tasks. The model achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.6 on unconditional image generation with the CelebA.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at IJCNN 2025 poster track</p></details> | None |
| **[Gradient Estimation Methods of Approximate Multipliers for High-Accuracy Retraining of Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10519v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However, AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D, characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs), providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | technical report | None |

Despite its significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language, specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL, focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign language.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

The framework operates plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under peer review for IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering</p></details> | None |

SPNv3 is designed and trained to be computationally efficient while providing robustness to spaceborne images that have not been observed during offline training and validation on the ground. These characteristics are essential to deploying NNs on space-grade edge devices. They are achieved through careful NN design choices, and an extensive trade-off analysis reveals features such as data augmentation, transfer learning and vision transformer architecture as a few of those that contribute to simultaneously maximizing robustness and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that the final SPNv3 can achieve state-of-the-art pose accuracy on hardware-in-the-loop images from a robotic testbed while having trained exclusively on computer-generated synthetic images, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real imagery. At the same time, SPNv3 runs well above the update frequency of modern satellite navigation filters when tested on a representative graphical processing unit system with flight heritage.

Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings, thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably, our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios. Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy) substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ANSyA 2025: 1st International Workshop on Advanced Neuro-Symbolic Applications</p></details> | None |

Application to Railway Defect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio. The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music, but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers (7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes: rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image. Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Hybrid Fully Convolutional CNN-Transformer Model for Inherently Interpretable Disease Detection from Retinal Fundus Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08481v4)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

| **[TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architecture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN-based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations. Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and memorability.

To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight, Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000 soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%, a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32 and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 23 pages, 6 images, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

| **[Shortcut Learning Susceptibility in Vision Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09150v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortcut learning, where machine learning models exploit spurious correlations in data instead of capturing meaningful features, poses a significant challenge to building robust and generalizable models. This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are correlated with class labels both positionally and via intensity, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing on two different test sets-one containing the same shortcuts and another without them-to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. Further, we evaluate susceptibility to shortcut learning across different learning rates. Our analysis reveals that CNNs at lower learning rates tend to be more reserved against entirely picking up shortcut features, while ViTs, particularly those without positional encodings, almost entirely ignore the distinctive image features in the presence of shortcuts.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that leverages relative spatial positions, visual appearance embeddings, and semantic class cues to identify and generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration that uses the matched feature correspondences to estimate an initial transformation between the LiDAR and camera frames, serving as the foundation for further refinement, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets demonstrate that CalibRefine achieves high-precision calibration with minimal human input, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and matching or surpassing manually tuned baselines. Our results show that robust object-level feature matching, combined with iterative refinement and self-supervised attention-based refinement, enables reliable sensor alignment in complex real-world conditions without ground-truth matrices or elaborate preprocessing.

| **[Surface Defect Detection with Gabor Filter Using Reconstruction-Based Blurring U-Net-ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00827v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP) masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics. Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Fairness in Skin Lesion Classification for Medical Diagnosis Using Prune Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00745v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

| **[EFTViT: Efficient Federated Training of Vision Transformers with Masked Images on Resource-Constrained Clients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00334v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

For computational efficiency these descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging the constructed dataset, we train YOLOv5 for real-time action detection, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier is deceloped via LoRA-based fine-tuning for action classification. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world industrial settings validate the effectiveness of LRIAR, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, scenario generalization, and deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figure | None |
