| **[Decorrelation Speeds Up Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14657v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[EDIT: Enhancing Vision Transformers by Mitigating Attention Sink through an Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06738v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose EDIT (Encoder-Decoder Image Transformer), a novel architecture designed to mitigate the attention sink phenomenon observed in Vision Transformer models. Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of attention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to effectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a layer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes self-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention to focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework, where the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT allows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features, progressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally interpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the refined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves consistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models. These results highlight the effectiveness of EDIT's design in addressing attention sink and improving visual feature extraction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapting Self-Supervised Representations as a Latent Space for Efficient Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14630v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective. This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/CompVis/RepTok</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/CompVis/RepTok) |
| **[Zero-Shot Wildlife Sorting Using Vision Transformers: Evaluating Clustering and Continuous Similarity Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14596v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor) combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a 5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2 with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract.

| **[Hierarchical Re-Classification: Combining Animal Classification Models with Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14594v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies, resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species. We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify 456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy, achieving species-level identification for 64.9 percent</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract.

| **[Towards Generalist Intelligence in Dentistry: Vision Foundation Models for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14532v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vision Mamba for Permeability Prediction of Porous Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14516v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically, a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time, a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Low Power Vision Transformer Accelerator with Hardware-Aware Pruning and Optimized Dataflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14393v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current transformer accelerators primarily focus on optimizing self-attention due to its quadratic complexity. However, this focus is less relevant for vision transformers with short token lengths, where the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) tends to be the dominant computational bottleneck. This paper presents a low power Vision Transformer accelerator, optimized through algorithm-hardware co-design. The model complexity is reduced using hardware-friendly dynamic token pruning without introducing complex mechanisms. Sparsity is further improved by replacing GELU with ReLU activations and employing dynamic FFN2 pruning, achieving a 61.5\% reduction in operations and a 59.3\% reduction in FFN2 weights, with an accuracy loss of less than 2\%. The hardware adopts a row-wise dataflow with output-oriented data access to eliminate data transposition, and supports dynamic operations with minimal area overhead. Implemented in TSMC's 28nm CMOS technology, our design occupies 496.4K gates and includes a 232KB SRAM buffer, achieving a peak throughput of 1024 GOPS at 1GHz, with an energy efficiency of 2.31 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 858.61 GOPS/mm2.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers</p></details> | None |
| **[ChA-MAEViT: Unifying Channel-Aware Masked Autoencoders and Multi-Channel Vision Transformers for Improved Cross-Channel Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19331v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

| **[Scaling Vision Transformers for Functional MRI with Flat Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13768v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data.

| **[DOLFIN: Balancing Stability and Plasticity in Federated Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13567v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments. Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Perspective-Aware Teaching: Adapting Knowledge for Heterogeneous Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08885v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained heavy teacher model to a lighter student model, thereby reducing the inference cost while maintaining comparable effectiveness. Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a perspective-aware teaching (PAT) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architectures. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

| **[Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the Bouba-Kiki Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10013v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like `bouba' with round shapes and `kiki' with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as a measure of model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel approach to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these model variants do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both model variants lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[TMT: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning for Transformer-Based Chest X-Ray Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12704v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization. While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally, it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iMIMIC at MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12660v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE). State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models. Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW 2025</p></details> | None |

Yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we fine-tuned the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), training only ~1.3M parameters in combination with extensive augmentation and a domain-weighted Focal Loss to handle domain heterogeneity. Despite the domain gap, our fine-tuned DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, reaching first place on the final test set. These results highlight the advantages of DINOv3 pretraining and underline the efficiency and robustness of our fine-tuning strategy, yielding state-of-the-art results for the atypical mitosis classification challenge in MIDOG 2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

| **[SpikePool: Event-driven Spiking Transformer with Pooling Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12102v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the success of transformers, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have increasingly been integrated with transformer architectures, leading to spiking transformers that demonstrate promising performance on event-based vision tasks. However, despite these empirical successes, there remains limited understanding of how spiking transformers fundamentally process event-based data. Current approaches primarily focus on architectural modifications without analyzing the underlying signal processing characteristics. In this work, we analyze spiking transformers through the frequency spectrum domain and discover that they behave as high-pass filters, contrasting with Vision Transformers (ViTs) that act as low-pass filters. This frequency domain analysis reveals why certain designs work well for event-based data, which contains valuable high-frequency information but is also sparse and noisy. Based on this observation, we propose SpikePool, which replaces spike-based self-attention with max pooling attention, a low-pass filtering operation, to create a selective band-pass filtering effect. This design preserves meaningful high-frequency content while capturing critical features and suppressing noise, achieving a better balance for event-based data processing. Our approach demonstrates competitive results on event-based datasets for both classification and object detection tasks while significantly reducing training and inference time by up to 42.5% and 32.8%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing the reliability of machine learning for gravitational wave parameter estimation with attention-based models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</p></details> | 9 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks: peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing at MICCAI 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Isolated Channel Vision Transformers: From Single-Channel Pretraining to Multi-Channel Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09826v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in standard RGB image processing tasks. However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI) data, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge. In particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different modalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary information and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method, named Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and thereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that this channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More importantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on downstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures dependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature representation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP and CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging, show that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance improvement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient training makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of foundation models on heterogeneous data.

| **[Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10779v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Scalable Face Security Vision Foundation Model for Deepfake, Diffusion, and Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10663v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

| **[UniRGB-IR: A Unified Framework for Visible-Infrared Semantic Tasks via Adapter Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17360v4)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained significant attention due to their enhanced accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions including low-illumination and adverse weather. However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR semantic tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Commonality-Oriented Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06992v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |

SAM2 employs a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however, fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Attention via Pre-Scoring: Prioritizing Informative Keys in Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11040v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhanced long-context language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual sampling. However, HyperAttention fails to find all significant keys, which in turn raises the overall perplexity. We propose a pre-scoring mechanism that prioritizes significant keys before applying HyperAttention. We introduce three scoring methods: $k$-means and kernel $k$-means clustering, $k$-median clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform residual sampling, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism. Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3, which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given specific parameters. Although this method introduces some computational overhead, its combination with HyperAttention achieves up to 20 times faster than FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving transformer efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.

| **[Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09794v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Decoding via Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients in Mouse Visual Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09451v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural responses to different visual stimuli is an important topic in exploring how the brain represents visual information. Currently, hierarchically deep neural networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data, within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests', which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e., fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that "the hierarchical information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy." Among them, we found that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant scientific value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

We analyze the inherent sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages 4 figures and 4 tables , accepted for 2025 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING, AUG. 31 to SEP. 3, 2025, ISTANBUL, TURKEY</p></details> | None |

This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> | None |

This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model, achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Resource-Constrained Training of Vision Transformers via Subspace Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09160v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy. However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla training.</p></details> |  | None |

To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image datasets collected from our implantation system.</p></details> | Accept by IROS 2025 | None |

However, this task is often done manually, requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github. com/ronan-39/tlt/).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshops 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08510v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TPAMI2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods rely on pixel sampling to identify successful interaction samples or processing pointclouds for affordance mapping. However, these approaches are computationally intensive and struggle to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments. This paper introduces ManipGPT, a framework designed to predict optimal interaction areas for articulated objects using a large pre-trained vision transformer (ViT). We create a dataset of 9.9k simulated and real images to bridge the visual sim-to-real gap and enhance real-world applicability. By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improve part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios. This enables effective manipulation across simulated and real-world environments by generating part-level affordance masks, paired with an impedance adaptation policy, sufficiently eliminating the need for complex datasets or perception systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

As a working baseline, we adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts. In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization: classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles. Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond linear sparsity alone. Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics via Object-Centric Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05674v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning</p></details> |  | None |

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Remaining Lifespan Prediction from Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13430v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.41 years on an established dataset, and further achieves 4.91 and 4.99 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.82 years on the Faces Dataset. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ISVC 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update after NIPS suggestions</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON) |

We propose cluster paths, a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load), weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness (predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task, they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes, textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and human-readable explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>techn...</summary><p>technical report, project url:https://onecat-ai.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention. These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,9 figures, 2025 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> | None |
| **[Attacking the Spike: On the Transferability and Security of Spiking Neural Networks to Adversarial Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03358v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Auto-Compressing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09714v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as auto-compression, the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 28 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[There is More to Attention: Statistical Filtering Enhances Explanations in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06070v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while remaining efficient and human plausible.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Vision Transformers for Enhanced Classification of Emotions using ECG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05826v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current leading techniques.</p></details> | 14pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05674v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning</p></details> |  | None |

We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2 from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90 age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%, specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data, enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification, we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2), which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and industrial domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13693v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comparative Study of Vision Transformers and CNNs for Few-Shot Rigid Transformation and Fundamental Matrix Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04794v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs) have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet) with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that, similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that balance local and global representations.</p></details> |  | None |

Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables, ~8000 words</p></details> | None |

However, they are not naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical image segmentation.

The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g., tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds). The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries. In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details. This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads.

We identify two bottlenecks: (1) costly electro--optic conversions and data-movement overheads that erode energy efficiency as model sizes scale; (2) a mismatch between limited on-chip photonic resources and Transformer scale, which forces frequent reuse of photonic tensor cores and dilutes throughput gains. To address these challenges, we introduce a hardware--software co-design framework. First, we propose \texttt{Lighten}, a PTC-aware compression flow that post-hoc decomposes each Transformer weight matrix into a low-rank component plus a structured-sparse component aligned to photonic tensor-core granularity, without lengthy retraining. Second, we present \texttt{ENLighten}, a reconfigurable photonic accelerator with dynamically adaptive tensor cores, driven by broadband light redistribution, enabling fine-grained sparsity support and full power gating of inactive parts. On ImageNet, \texttt{Lighten} prunes a Base-scale Vision Transformer by 50\% with $\approx$1\% accuracy drop after only 3 epochs (about 1 hour) of fine-tuning. Deployed on \texttt{ENLighten}, it achieves a $2.5\times$ improvement in energy--delay product over the state-of-the-art photonic Transformer accelerator.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 page version is accepted by ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> | None |

These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the article to appear in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.

Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex, resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4 quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points (also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art results of 96,9% with 32 channels.

We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle this issue, we propose a cognitive digital twin framework that combines real-time EEG signals from a wearable skullcap with structural MRI data for dynamic and personalized tumor monitoring. At the heart of this framework is an Enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT++) that includes innovative components like Patch-Level Attention Regularization (PLAR) and an Adaptive Threshold Mechanism to improve tumor localization and understanding. A Bidirectional LSTM-based neural classifier analyzes EEG patterns over time to classify brain states such as seizure, interictal, and healthy. Grad-CAM-based heatmaps and a three.js-powered 3D visualization module provide interactive anatomical insights. Furthermore, a tumor kinetics engine predicts volumetric growth by looking at changes in MRI trends and anomalies from EEG data. With impressive accuracy metrics of 94.6% precision, 93.2% recall, and a Dice score of 0.91, this framework sets a new standard for real-time, interpretable neurodiagnostics. It paves the way for future advancements in intelligent brain health monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cutting the Skip: Training Residual-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00345v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.</p></details> |  | None |

While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs, attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662 images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million (M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%, 87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability, providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A quantitative analysis of semantic information in deep representations of text and images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the feature representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 8figures, 4tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Transformers through the lens of support-preserving maps between measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25611v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.</p></details> |  | None |

With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics (model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93% test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs retain an efficiency edge.

However, vision systems trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain. Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1 0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision (around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates, and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

While smoothness has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this, we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance. Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.</p></details> |  | None |

To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

We identify \emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense.</p></details> |  | None |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

We present a continual learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at 0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable, privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI That Keeps Up: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Continual and Compatible Foundation Model Updates</p></details> | None |

Existing methods, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details. Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI systems for subjective visual assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction, dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Though previous VLP works have proved the effectiveness of ViTs, they still suffer from computational efficiency brought by the long visual sequence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model with \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mage \textbf{P}atch \textbf{S}election, namely TRIPS, which reduces the visual sequence progressively with a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone for efficient training and inference. The patch-selection layer can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify the attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, TRIPS does not introduce extra parameters to ViTs. Experimental results on a variety of popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TRIPS gain a speedup of 40\% over previous similar VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Token Merging via Spatiotemporal Information Mining for Surgical Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23672v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However, current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM) method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically, the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner, STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional Mamba architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse degradations, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations. First, QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026.

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, revised version</p></details> | None |
| **[Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures | None |

The study specifically focused on addressing real-world challenges such as data imbalance, which is often overlooked in existing literature. Study Design: The Oral Diseases dataset was used to train and validate the selected models. Performance metrics, including validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were measured, with special emphasis on how well each architecture managed imbalanced classes. Results: ConvNeXt achieved the highest validation accuracy at 81.06, followed by BEiT at 80.00 and Swin Transformer at 79.73, all demonstrating strong F1-scores. ViT and DeiT achieved accuracies of 79.37 and 78.79, respectively, but both struggled particularly with Caries-related classes. Conclusions: ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and BEiT showed reliable diagnostic performance, making them promising candidates for clinical application in dental imaging.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%. Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.</p></details> |  | None |

Model predictions serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation. Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.</p></details> |  | None |

These scenarios commonly operate under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution, particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being 10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques.

These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training. In this work, we describe a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics: we identify two novel \textit{dynamical} scaling laws that govern how performance evolves as function of different norm-based complexity measures. Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a single-layer perceptron trained with logistic loss, where we derive the new dynamical scaling laws, and we explain them through the implicit bias induced by gradient-based training.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 20 Figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike convolutional neural networks, vision transformers inherently capture long-range dependencies and enable parallel processing, yet lack inductive biases and efficiency benefits, facing significant computational and memory challenges that limit its real-world applicability. This paper surveys various online strategies for generating lightweight vision transformers for image recognition, focusing on three key areas: Efficient Component Design, Dynamic Network, and Knowledge Distillation. We evaluate the relevant exploration for each topic on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, analyzing trade-offs among precision, parameters, throughput, and more to highlight their respective advantages, disadvantages, and flexibility.

MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PreLoRA: Hybrid Pre-training of Vision Transformers with Full Training and Low-Rank Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21619v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank. Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence. Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size, resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 algorithms, 1 table, conference paper</p></details> | None |
| **[VLCE: A Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Image Description in Disaster Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21609v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> | None |

We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures | None |

Drawing on this neuroscientific inspiration, we investigate the effect of introducing patches from different spatial frequencies into Vision Transformers (ViTs). We name this model Retina Vision Transformer (RetinaViT) due to its inspiration from the human visual system. Our experiments on benchmark data show that RetinaViT exhibits a strong tendency to attend to low spatial frequency components in the early layers, and shifts its attention to high spatial frequency components as the network goes deeper. This tendency emerged by itself without any additional inductive bias, and aligns with the visual processing order of the human visual system. We hypothesise that RetinaViT captures structural features, or the gist of the scene, in earlier layers, before attending to fine details in subsequent layers, which is the reverse of the processing order of mainstream backbone vision models, such as CNNs. We also observe that RetinaViT is more robust to significant reductions in model size compared to the original ViT, which we hypothesise to have come from its ability to capture the gist of the scene early.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by injecting them into the Action Expert. RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic intelligence.

Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Sensors + Imaging; presented on 17th of September (Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications III)</p></details> | None |

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 12 pages (including 3 pages of references), 6 figures, 6 tables.

Therefore, building efficient and general-purpose visual backbones based on SSMs is a promising direction. Compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM) methods is not yet fully competitive. To enable SSMs to process image data, ViMs typically flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, inevitably ignoring some 2D local dependencies, thereby weakening the model's ability to interpret spatial relationships from a global perspective. We use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the spectrum of the feature map and add it to the original feature map, enabling ViM to model a unified visual representation in both frequency and spatial domains. The introduction of frequency domain information enables ViM to have a global receptive field during scanning. We propose a novel model called Vim-F, which employs pure Mamba encoders and scans in both the frequency and spatial domains. Moreover, we question the necessity of position embedding in ViM and remove it accordingly in Vim-F, which helps to fully utilize the efficient long-sequence modeling capability of ViM. Finally, we redesign a patch embedding for Vim-F, leveraging a convolutional stem to capture more local correlations, further improving the performance of Vim-F.

| **[Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20939v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 7 tables, code is available at https://github.com/tiny-smart/tasselnetv4</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/tiny-smart/tasselnetv4) |

We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports, LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations. These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants.

This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, minor typo fix, not final version, Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a more serious challenge. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. Additionally, we propose a scheme to predict task identity with confidence and calibrate the model's outputs accordingly. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and computation efficiency in training over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | Latest reversion | None |

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Weakly Supervised Food Image Segmentation using Vision Transformers and Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19028v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> | None |
| **[No Labels Needed: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Collaborative Self-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18938v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Lightweight Vision Transformer with Window and Spatial Attention for Food Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18692v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LEAF-Mamba: Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion State Space Model for RGB-D Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18683v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient Breast and Ovarian Cancer Classification via ViT-Based Preprocessing and Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18553v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |

Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to WACV 2026 application track, model weights available at: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/PulmonaryEmbolismSegmentation</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/PulmonaryEmbolismSegmentation) |
| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha) |

These models are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains - particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks - remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner, specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE (Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance. GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures | None |

To assess progress in this area, the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge relies on a new test set of 2,105 high-resolution multi-label images annotated by experts and covering around 400 species. It also provides a large training set of 1.4 million individual plant images, along with vision transformer models pre-trained on this data. The task is formulated as a (weakly labelled) multi-label classification problem, where the goal is to predict all species present in a quadrat image using single-label training data.

| **[Visual Instruction Pretraining for Domain-Specific Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17562v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation.

This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models. Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures | None |

Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the \textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba (Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for complex visual assessment tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels. We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity. We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.</p></details> | - | None |

Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms in AI systems.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[SPH-Net: A Co-Attention Hybrid Model for Accurate Stock Price Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15414v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of stock price movements presents a formidable challenge in financial analytics due to the inherent volatility, non-stationarity, and nonlinear characteristics of market data. This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise. By significantly improving prediction accuracy in financial time series analysis, SPH-Net provides valuable decision-support capabilities for investors and financial analysts, potentially enabling more informed investment strategies and risk assessment in volatile market conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.</p></details> | 24 pages, XAI 2025 | None |
| **[Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15058v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL) framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack. This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were found and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages article, 29 pdf pages, 19 figures, MLRC.

| **[Fast Multipole Attention: A Scalable Multilevel Attention Mechanism for Text and Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11960v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformer networks benefit from a global receptive field, their quadratic cost relative to sequence length restricts their application to long sequences and high-resolution inputs. We introduce Fast Multipole Attention (FMA), a divide-and-conquer mechanism for self-attention inspired by the Fast Multipole Method from n-body physics. FMA reduces the time and memory complexity of self-attention from $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ while preserving full-context interactions. FMA contains a learned hierarchy with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ levels of resolution. In this hierarchy, nearby tokens interact at full resolution, while distant tokens engage through progressively coarser, learned basis functions. We have developed both 1D and 2D implementations of FMA for language and vision tasks, respectively. On autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling benchmarks, the 1D variant either matches or outperforms leading efficient attention baselines with substantially lower memory use. With linear complexity, the 2D variant demonstrates superior performance over strong vision transformer baselines in classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our results confirm that the multilevel attention implemented by FMA allows Transformer-based models to scale to much longer sequences and higher-resolution inputs without loss in accuracy. This provides a principled, physics-inspired approach for developing scalable neural networks suitable for language, vision, and multimodal tasks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/epoch98/FMA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/epoch98/FMA) |

Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to 1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the final encoder layer.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations.

This paper introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted at IEEE INDISCON 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13255v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce \textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA (\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++ consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of +0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures | None |

While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rome, Italy 2025</p></details> | None |

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required.

Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this setting, federated training happens after a stable point has been reached through conventional training. Global model weights are first centrally pretrained by the server on a public dataset following which only the last few linear layers (the classification head) of the model are finetuned across clients. In this scenario, existing data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) in FL show two key weaknesses. First, strongly input-correlated gradient information from the initial model layers is never shared, significantly degrading reconstruction accuracy. Second, DRAs in which the server makes highly specific, handcrafted manipulations to the model structure or parameters (for e.g., layers with all zero weights, identity mappings and rows with identical weight patterns) are easily detectable by an active client. Improving on these, we propose MAUI, a stealthy DRA that does not require any overt manipulations to the model architecture or weights, and relies solely on the gradients of the classification head. MAUI first extracts "robust" feature representations of the input batch from the gradients of the classification head and subsequently inverts these representations to the original inputs. We report highly accurate reconstructions on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets on a variety of model architectures including convolution networks (CNN, VGG11), ResNets (18, 50), ShuffleNet-V2 and Vision Transformer (ViT B-32), regardless of the batch size. MAUI significantly outperforms prior DRAs in reconstruction quality, achieving 40-120% higher PSNR scores.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%.

To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</p></details> |  | None |

A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Differential privacy offers principled protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds, which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds only the difference between the required noise and what has already been accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal, and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP). PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions, PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80% with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

Speculum-free devices that integrate imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913 frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm 0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches. External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both high- and low-resource contexts.</p></details> | 2 pages | None |

Quantization offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling, ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably, even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath) method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers, improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to baseline and linear DropPath schedules.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 tables | None |

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> | None |

Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary Information will be provided with the published manuscript</p></details> | None |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third (tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert decision-making in forensic age estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, Scientific Reports</p></details> | None |

This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, 17 figure | None |
| **[Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</p></details> |  | None |

To balance computation efficiency and performance in downstream vision tasks, we propose an efficient ViT model with sparse attention (dubbed SAEViT) and convolution blocks. Specifically, a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module has been proposed to perform adaptive sparse sampling and recover the feature map via deconvolution operation,} which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, which mitigates the redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FFN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for fundamental vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TESSER: Transfer-Enhancing Adversarial Attacks from Vision Transformers via Spectral and Semantic Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19613v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.</p></details> |  | None |

Although histopathologic examination remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature. Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a 2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision.

In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

Leveraging additional modalities (X-modality) like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB provides complementary information, enabling more robust and reliable prediction. In this work, we introduce Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation utilizing the advanced Mamba. Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs, with their limited local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which offer global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic complexity, our model achieves global receptive fields with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder and innovating a Mamba-based fusion mechanism, we effectively select essential information from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhance the channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our proposed method is rigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application of State Space Models (SSMs) in multi-modal perception tasks.

However, their global modeling often comes with substantial computational overhead, in stark contrast to the human eye's efficient information processing. Inspired by the human eye's sparse scanning mechanism, we propose a \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention mechanism ($\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$). This mechanism predefines a series of Anchors of Interest for each token and employs local attention to efficiently model the spatial information around these anchors, avoiding redundant global modeling and excessive focus on local information. This approach mirrors the human eye's functionality and significantly reduces the computational load of vision models. Building on $\rm{S}^3\rm{A}$, we introduce the \textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}can \textbf{Vi}sion \textbf{T}ransformer (SSViT). Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of SSViT across a variety of tasks. Specifically, on ImageNet classification, without additional supervision or training data, SSViT achieves top-1 accuracies of \textbf{84.4\%/85.7\%} with \textbf{4.4G/18.2G} FLOPs. SSViT also excels in downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy, 99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0% accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%, outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment in real-world clinical screening systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
