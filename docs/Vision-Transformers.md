| **[Prompt-based Dynamic Token Pruning for Efficient Segmentation of Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16369v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in processing a large number of tokens often constrain their practical application in analyzing medical images. This research proposes a Prompt-driven Adaptive Token ({\it PrATo}) pruning method to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent stages. This data-driven pruning strategy improves segmentation accuracy and inference speed by allocating computational resources to essential regions. The proposed framework is integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant tokens, thereby enhancing computational efficiency while preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of $\sim$ 35-55% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework, facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively. We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including 63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture, 93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Hybrid Fully Convolutional CNN-Transformer Model for Inherently Interpretable Disease Detection from Retinal Fundus Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08481v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

| **[Disentangling the Factors of Convergence between Brains and Computer Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18226v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explain and Monitor Deep Learning Models for Computer Vision using Obz AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18188v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes. Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey of the Self Supervised Learning Mechanisms for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17059v6)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in deep learning are re-defining how visual data is processed and understand by the machines. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated prominent performance in computer vision related tasks. However, their performance improves with increasing numbers of labeled data, indicating reliance on labeled data. Humanly annotated data are difficult to acquire and thus shifted the focus from traditional annotations to unsupervised learning strategies that learn structures inside the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique. SSL utilize inherent relationships within the data as a form of supervision. This technique can reduce the dependence on manual annotations and offers a more scalable and resource-effective approach to training models. Taking these strengths into account, it is necessary to assess the combination of SSL methods with ViTs, especially in the cases of limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we highlighted the motivations behind the study of SSL, reviewed prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 Pa...</summary><p>42 Pages, 4 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Edge-Enhanced Vision Transformer Framework for Accurate AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17877v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures, weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for real-world applications in automated content verification and digital forensics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v6)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD detection performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to significantly reduced overhead for OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](http://github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars) |
| **[Open-Set Deepfake Detection: A Parameter-Efficient Adaptation Method with Forgery Style Mixture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12791v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-set face forgery detection poses significant security threats and presents substantial challenges for existing detection models. These detectors primarily have two limitations: they cannot generalize across unknown forgery domains and inefficiently adapt to new data. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that is both general and parameter-efficient for face forgery detection. It builds on the assumption that different forgery source domains exhibit distinct style statistics. Previous methods typically require fully fine-tuning pre-trained networks, consuming substantial time and computational resources. In turn, we design a forgery-style mixture formulation that augments the diversity of forgery source domains, enhancing the model's generalizability across unseen domains. Drawing on recent advancements in vision transformers (ViT) for face forgery detection, we develop a parameter-efficient ViT-based detection model that includes lightweight forgery feature extraction modules and enables the model to extract global and local forgery clues simultaneously. We only optimize the inserted lightweight modules during training, maintaining the original ViT structure with its pre-trained ImageNet weights. This training strategy effectively preserves the informative pre-trained knowledge while flexibly adapting the model to the task of Deepfake detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the designed model achieves state-of-the-art generalizability with significantly reduced trainable parameters, representing an important step toward open-set Deepfake detection in the wild.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Interpretability in Alzheimer's Prediction via Joint Learning of ADAS-Cog Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17619v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score, an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1 (Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability. Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance, where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD prediction frameworks.

| **[A Weighted Vision Transformer-Based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Predicting ADAS-Cog Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17613v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13 sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DinoTwins: Combining DINO and Barlow Twins for Robust, Label-Efficient Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17509v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware. By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model. This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives. Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification accuracy and data distribution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Combating Digitally Altered Images: Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16975v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Deepfake technology to generate hyper-realistic manipulated images and videos poses a significant challenge to the public and relevant authorities. This study presents a robust Deepfake detection based on a modified Vision Transformer(ViT) model, trained to distinguish between real and Deepfake images. The model has been trained on a subset of the OpenForensics Dataset with multiple augmentation techniques to increase robustness for diverse image manipulations. The class imbalance issues are handled by oversampling and a train-validation split of the dataset in a stratified manner. Performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric on the training and testing datasets, followed by a prediction score on a random image of people, irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Lightweight Convolution and Vision Transformer integrated model with Multi-scale Self-attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16884v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Curious Case of Remarkable Resilience to Gradient Attacks via Fully Convolutional and Differentiable Front End with a Skip Connection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17018v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components. The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks. Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

| **[Exploiting Information Redundancy in Attention Maps for Extreme Quantization of Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16311v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

ViTs require enormous datasets for training. We introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach that distils inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models to make their applications practical. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to jointly instruct the student transformer. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework LIB-KD also involves precomputing and keeping logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimisation can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization.

| **[Learning Motion Blur Robust Vision Transformers for Real-Time UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05383v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is critical for applications like surveillance, search-and-rescue, and autonomous navigation. However, the high-speed movement of UAVs and targets introduces unique challenges, including real-time processing demands and severe motion blur, which degrade the performance of existing generic trackers. While single-stream vision transformer (ViT) architectures have shown promise in visual tracking, their computational inefficiency and lack of UAV-specific optimizations limit their practicality in this domain. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. We refer to our proposed approach as BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on four tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a practical and effective approach for real-time UAV tracking.

We employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000, covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the distilled student model maintains high classification performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical, trustworthy medical AI solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer. The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%. Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  | None |

However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI) detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50 consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2) the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops 2025 (ICCVW 2025)</p></details> | None |

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

Our approach, which incorporates a frozen LLM transformer block into the encoder of a ViT-based model, leads to substantial improvements in segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities. We propose a Hybrid Attention Mechanism that combines global and local feature learning with a Multi-Scale Fusion Block for aggregating features across different scales. The enhanced model shows significant performance gains, including an average Dice score increase from 0.74 to 0.79 and improvements in accuracy, precision, and the Jaccard Index.

Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has just been accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SEDEG:Sequential Enhancement of Decoder and Encoder's Generality for Class Incremental Learning with Small Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12932v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components.

However, modern CL techniques focus on provisioning memory capabilities to existing DNN models rather than designing new ones that are able to adapt according to the task at hand. This paper presents the novel Feedback Continual Learning Vision Transformer (FCL-ViT) that uses a feedback mechanism to generate real-time dynamic attention features tailored to the current task. The FCL-ViT operates in two Phases. In phase 1, the generic image features are produced and determine where the Transformer should attend on the current image. In phase 2, task-specific image features are generated that leverage dynamic attention. To this end, Tunable self-Attention Blocks (TABs) and Task Specific Blocks (TSBs) are introduced that operate in both phases and are responsible for tuning the TABs attention, respectively. The FCL-ViT surpasses state-of-the-art performance on Continual Learning compared to benchmark methods, while retaining a small number of trainable DNN parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

We have used pre-trained models based on convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers ($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$, and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for $TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly, revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; v2: camera ready</p></details> | None |

These models typically combine a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces \textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank adaptation.

However, existing research primarily focuses on refining ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

The attention pooling mechanism refines the focus on the most informative regions, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods while remaining parameter-efficient and explainable. Furthermore, we compare our method with traditional lightweight convolutional neural network and vision transformer architectures, showing improved performance while maintaining a significantly lower parameter count. Our results highlight the potential of NCA-based models an alternative for explainable image classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369v4)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.</p></details> |  | None |

However, preserving the privacy of both user inputs and fine-tuned adapters -- often trained on sensitive data -- during inference remains a significant challenge. Applying cryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation (MPC), to PEFT settings still incurs substantial encrypted computation across both the backbone and adapter, mainly due to the inherent two-way communication between them. To address this limitation, we propose CryptPEFT, the first PEFT solution specifically designed for private inference scenarios. CryptPEFT introduces a novel one-way communication (OWC) architecture that confines encrypted computation solely to the adapter, significantly reducing both computational and communication overhead. To maintain strong model utility under this constraint, we explore the design space of OWC-compatible adapters and employ an automated architecture search algorithm to optimize the trade-off between private inference efficiency and model utility. We evaluated CryptPEFT using Vision Transformer backbones across widely used image classification datasets. Our results show that CryptPEFT significantly outperforms existing baselines, delivering speedups ranging from $20.62\times$ to $291.48\times$ in simulated wide-area network (WAN) and local-area network (LAN) settings. On CIFAR-100, CryptPEFT attains 85.47% accuracy with just 2.26 seconds of inference latency. These findings demonstrate that CryptPEFT offers an efficient and privacy-preserving solution for modern PEFT-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for the paper accepted for presentation at NDSS 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Ovis2.5 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11737v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints.

To achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose AVTrack, an adaptive computation tracking framework that adaptively activates transformer blocks through an Activation Module (AM), which dynamically optimizes the ViT architecture by selectively engaging relevant components. To address extreme viewpoint variations, we propose to learn view-invariant representations via mutual information (MI) maximization. In addition, we propose AVTrack-MD, an enhanced tracker incorporating a novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework. Leveraging multiple off-the-shelf AVTrack models as teachers, we maximize the MI between their aggregated softened features and the corresponding softened feature of the student model, improving the generalization and performance of the student, especially under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments show that AVTrack-MD achieves performance comparable to AVTrack's performance while reducing model complexity and boosting average tracking speed by over 17\%.

| **[Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03174v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures | None |

Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a novel lightweight vision transformer with phase-only cross-attention (POC-ViT) using dual biometric traits of forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural patterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only correlation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural patterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against variations in resolution and intensity, as well as illumination changes in the input images. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database, having 350 subjects. The POC-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.</p></details> | Submitted to IEEE | None |

One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations.

We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluating their Perceptual Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09850v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size, data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%.

It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.</p></details> |  | None |

These challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments, including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.</p></details> |  | None |

Although attention weights do not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks, highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds.

We hypothesize that this gap is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) (labelled) image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. We address this challenge through self pre-training, where models are pre-trained directly on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a resource-efficient vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10,000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in microelectronics. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models attend to defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material, while baseline models often attend to spurious patterns. This shows that our approach yields defect-specific feature representations, resulting in more interpretable and generalizable transformer models for this data-sparse domain.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, due to the heterogeneity of tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories. With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides, OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS, significantly outperforming prior models.</p></details> |  | None |

The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling, uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under 0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

However, their effectiveness is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g., abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective, Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens. These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer (THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection. Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures | None |

The proposed framework exploits attention-based importance extracted from a pretrained ViT to jointly optimize quantization levels, subcarrier mapping, and power allocation. Specifically, IA-QSMPA maps semantically important features to high-quality subchannels and allocates resources in accordance with their contribution to task performance and communication latency. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, a block coordinate descent algorithm is employed. The framework is further extended to operate under finite blocklength transmission, where communication errors may occur. In this setting, a segment-wise linear approximation of the channel dispersion penalty is introduced to enable efficient joint optimization under practical constraints. Simulation results on a multi-view image classification task using the MVP-N dataset demonstrate that IA-QSMPA significantly outperforms conventional methods in both ideal and finite blocklength transmission scenarios, achieving superior task performance and communication efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Visual Transformer for Sim2real Transfer in Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09180v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems, and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning process. Simulation results demonstrate that our visual backbone can focus more on task-related regions and exhibit better generalization in unseen scenarios. For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to deploy domain randomization over training processes. Finally, the feasibility of our model is validated to perform real-world manipulation tasks via zero-shot transfer.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting Layer Normalization Fine-tuning in Visual Transformer Foundation Models for Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07577v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts) are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher $\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.</p></details> |  | None |

Given its rapid spread among susceptible individuals, fast and reliable diagnostic systems are critical for early prevention and containment. In this work, we applied transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model for distinguishing measles rashes from other skin conditions. Trained on a diverse, curated skin rash image dataset, the DeiT model achieved a median classification accuracy of 96.38%, precision of 96.24%, recall of 96.38%, and an F1-score of 96.23%, demonstrating high effectiveness in accurate detection to aid outbreak control.

| **[Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision transformers model long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet) expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance. Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding 79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Inspired by neuroscience methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its generalizability and interpretive value.</p></details> | 7 pages,12 figures | None |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories: hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches, modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI/ML...</summary><p>AI/ML, Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

These inputs should ideally be inferred at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos at once.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles.

| **[Transformer-Based Explainable Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography: The MammoFormer Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06137v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast cancer detection through mammography interpretation remains difficult because of the minimal nature of abnormalities that experts need to identify alongside the variable interpretations between readers. The potential of CNNs for medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both local information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide explainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics. The researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites transformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and XAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures consisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were tested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images, negative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of oriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical adoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic optimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature enhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive explainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic interpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN reliability with transformer global context modeling. The combination of transformer models with suitable feature enhancements enables them to achieve equal or better results than CNN approaches. ViT achieves 98.3% accuracy alongside AHE while Swin Transformer gains a 13.0% advantage through HOG enhancements</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos. However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time, resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective, fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens, TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.</p></details> |  | None |

As such, development of automated systems capable of detecting such events is of considerable importance in both academic and industrial contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning for detecting thermal runaway in the battery production line of VDL Nedcar, a Dutch automobile manufacturer. Specifically, we collect data from the production line to represent both baseline (non thermal runaway) and thermal runaway conditions. Thermal runaway was simulated through the use of external heat and smoke sources. The data consisted of both optical and thermal images which were then preprocessed and fused before serving as input to our models. In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs. The obtained results indicate that the use of deep learning is a viable approach to thermal runaway detection in battery production lines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in the 8th IEEE Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) in Emden, Germany, May 12-15, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CoCAViT: Compact Vision Transformer with Robust Global Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05307v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, while maintaining low latency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EndoMatcher: Generalizable Endoscopic Image Matcher via Multi-Domain Pre-training for Robot-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05205v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes, distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion. Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset, achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher) |
| **[Modeling Rapid Contextual Learning in the Visual Cortex with Fast-Weight Deep Autoencoder Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04988v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling. Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2) Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context. (4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights. Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for studying rapid global context learning in the brain.</p></details> |  | None |

There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.</p></details> |  | None |

However, not all modalities are always available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model. Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs (MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography (CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs, we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization, then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps, capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL distillation.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 2 Figures | None |

Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose and validate a novel metric, k-value, to quantify the information richness of an image set, and we further investigate its effect on consumers' purchase decisions. We leverage patch-level embeddings from Vision Transformers (ViT) and apply k-means clustering to identify distinct visual features, defining k-value as the number of clusters. An online experiment demonstrates that k-value aligns with human-perceived information richness, validating the metric. A simulated online shopping experiment further reveals a significant yet counterintuitive result: while an image set with a higher k-value (richer information) shortens decision time, it paradoxically reduces purchase propensity. Our findings illuminate the complex relationship between visual information richness and consumer behavior, providing sellers a quantifiable tool for image selection.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we revisit logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element: Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, conference, 8 Tables</p></details> | None |

While prior work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive, epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. We evaluate 13 uncertainty quantification methods for convolutional (ResNet) and transformer-based (Vision Transformer) architectures across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we extend Evidential Deep Learning, HetClass NNs, and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty to the multi-label setting. Our analysis provides insights into uncertainty estimation effectiveness and the ability to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, revealing method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Foundation Models for Mitotic Figure Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04441v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TCSAFormer: Efficient Vision Transformer with Token Compression and Sparse Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04058v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models' ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information, thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables; The code is available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/TCSAFormer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiaZunhui/TCSAFormer) |
| **[Investigating the Impact of Large-Scale Pre-training on Nutritional Content Estimation from 2D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03996v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore, reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

This paper presents an AI-driven approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children's engagement using visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration. Utilizing the Child-Play gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g., engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated three state-of-the-art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer. Among these, the Swin Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 97.58%, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention. Our results highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, automated engagement analysis in real-world educational settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MedFormer: Hierarchical Medical Vision Transformer with Content-Aware Dual Sparse Selection Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02488v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities. Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is designed to explicitly attend to the most relevant content. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MedFormer outperforms existing medical vision transformers in terms of generality and efficiency. Extensive experiments across various imaging modality datasets show that MedFormer consistently enhances performance in all three medical image recognition tasks mentioned above. MedFormer provides an efficient and versatile solution for medical image recognition, with strong potential for clinical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables; The code is available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer) |
| **[Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04841v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, P2F demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across the board.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neutralizing Token Aggregation via Information Augmentation for Efficient Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03388v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Talking to DINO: Bridging Self-Supervised Vision Backbones with Language for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19331v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

In recent years, AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three diagnostically important cough classification tasks. Experimental results show that our representations match or exceed current state-of-the-art supervised audio representations in enhancing performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to ISWC | None |

However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.</p></details> |  | None |

A quality-aware modular deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images, a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper submitted to IEEE-AIOT 2025</p></details> | None |

While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages + references, 5 figures, 2 tables in IEEE double column conference template</p></details> | None |

Additionally, innovative breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1) Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2) Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW datasets.

Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements. The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, EMBC2025</p></details> | None |

To overcome this, we propose an implicit program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability across different motion reasoning datasets.

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively removing less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding non-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique challenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in time-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the first time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models using Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance and computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of AudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy. Our analysis reveals that while high-intensity or high-variation tokens contribute significantly to model accuracy, low-intensity or low variation tokens also remain important when token pruning is applied; pruning solely based on the intensity or variation of signals in a patch leads to a noticeable drop in accuracy. We support our claim by measuring high correlation between attention scores and these statistical features and by showing retained tokens consistently receive distinct attention compared to pruned ones. We also show that AudioMAE retains more low-intensity tokens than AST. This can be explained by AudioMAE's self-supervised reconstruction objective, which encourages attention to all patches, whereas AST's supervised training focuses on label-relevant tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks that reveal architectural details without physical access remains underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target. This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel leakage in deployed transformer models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, 2025</p></details> | None |

Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in Smart Agriculture Technology</p></details> | None |

However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs.

| **[MGCR-Net:Multimodal Graph-Conditioned Vision-Language Reconstruction Network for Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01555v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of remote sensing satellite technology and the rapid progress of deep learning, remote sensing change detection (RSCD) has become a key technique for regional monitoring. Traditional change detection (CD) methods and deep learning-based approaches have made significant contributions to change analysis and detection, however, many outstanding methods still face limitations in the exploration and application of multimodal data. To address this, we propose the multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language reconstruction network (MGCR-Net) to further explore the semantic interaction capabilities of multimodal data. Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have attracted widespread attention for their outstanding performance in computer vision, particularly due to their powerful visual-language understanding and dialogic interaction capabilities. Specifically, we design a MLLM-based optimization strategy to generate multimodal textual data from the original CD images, which serve as textual input to MGCR. Visual and textual features are extracted through a dual encoder framework. For the first time in the RSCD task, we introduce a multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language reconstruction mechanism, which is integrated with graph attention to construct a semantic graph-conditioned reconstruction module (SGCM), this module generates vision-language (VL) tokens through graph-based conditions and enables cross-dimensional interaction between visual and textual features via multihead attention. The reconstructed VL features are then deeply fused using the language vision transformer (LViT), achieving fine-grained feature alignment and high-level semantic interaction. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that MGCR achieves superior performance compared to mainstream CD methods.

| **[AlphaViT: A flexible game-playing AI for multiple games and variable board sizes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13871v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present three game-playing agents incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT) into the AlphaZero framework: AlphaViT, AlphaViD (AlphaViT with a transformer decoder), and AlphaVDA (AlphaViD with learnable action embeddings). These agents can play multiple board games of varying sizes using a single neural network with shared weights, thus overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed board sizes. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both a transformer encoder and a decoder. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses learnable embeddings as the decoder inputs. The additional decoder in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provides flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or on multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms, such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search. They approach the performance of AlphaZero despite relying on a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT performs strongly across all evaluated games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN with weights pre-trained on small board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, that of single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures for developing more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Predicting EGFR Mutation in LUAD from Histopathological Whole-Slide Images Using Pretrained Foundation Model and Transfer Learning: An Indian Cohort Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01352v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FloorplanMAE:A self-supervised framework for complete floorplan generation from partial inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08363v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process. Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs, improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones. First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet, specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad application prospects.</p></details> |  | None |

Large clusters with shared L1 memory, a common architectural pattern, struggle to fully utilize their processing elements (PEs) when scaled up due to reduced throughput in the hierarchical PE-to-L1 intra-cluster interconnect. This paper presents Dynamic Allocation Scheme (DAS), a runtime programmable address remapping hardware unit coupled with a unified memory allocator, designed to minimize data access contention of PEs onto the multi-banked L1. We evaluated DAS on an aggressively scaled-up 1024-PE RISC-V cluster with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) PE-to-L1 interconnect to demonstrate its potential for improving data locality in large parallel machine learning workloads. For a Vision Transformer (ViT)-L/16 model, each encoder layer executes in 5.67 ms, achieving a 1.94x speedup over the fixed word-level interleaved baseline with 0.81 PE utilization. Implemented in 12nm FinFET technology, DAS incurs <0.1 % area overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 36th IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors</p></details> | None |

However, existing mobile models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT) tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis.

| **[Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Anomaly Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01045v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload. Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs, leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[FakeIDet: Exploring Patches for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07761v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying the authenticity of identity documents (IDs) has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, there are no publicly available data from real IDs for proper research in this area, and most published studies rely on proprietary internal databases that are not available for privacy reasons. In order to advance this critical challenge of real data scarcity that makes it so difficult to advance the technology of machine learning-based fake ID detection, we introduce a new patch-based methodology that trades off privacy and performance, and propose a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-aware fake ID detection: FakeIDet. In our experiments, we explore: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. State-of-the-art methods, such as vision transformers and foundation models, are considered as backbones. Our results show that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal for fake ID detection achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at the patch and the whole ID level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to the path-based methodology introduced and the new FakeIDet method based on it, another key contribution of our article is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from real and fake IDs, called FakeIDet-db, together with the experimental framework.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods struggle when dynamic objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of cross-frame uncertainty propagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for GCPR 2025.

Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss, requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds, thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30% reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their original accuracy.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 | None |
| **[AniMer+: Unified Pose and Shape Estimation Across Mammalia and Aves via Family-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00298v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.00837</p></details> | None |

Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partly supported by the RA Science Committee grant No. 22rl-052 (DISTAL) and the EU under Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU on "Telecommunications of the Future" (PE00000001 - program "RESTART")</p></details> | None |

The analy- sis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  | None |

Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\% in NSS compared to GradCAM). This comparison enhances our confidence in FovEx's ability to close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Journal of Computer Vision (Springer Nature)</p></details> | None |

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures | None |

Identifying mild syndrome with small pathological regions serves as an ominous warning and is fundamental in the early diagnosis of diseases. While deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in segmenting medical objects, analyzing small areas in medical images remains challenging. This difficulty arises due to information losses and compression defects from convolution and pooling operations in CNNs, which become more pronounced as the network deepens, especially for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurately segmenting small-scale objects in medical images. The SvANet consists of scale-variant attention, cross-scale guidance, Monte Carlo attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective receptive field $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities.

While deep learning models have advanced scanpath prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation, allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |

The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b) self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer. The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

| **[Spatiodynamic inference using vision-based generative modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22256v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge. Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies. These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate dynamical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these sectors face considerable challenges, including climate variability, resource limitations, and the need for sustainable management. Addressing these issues requires efficient, accurate, and scalable technological solutions, highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence (AI). This survey presents a systematic and thorough review of more than 200 research works covering conventional machine learning approaches, advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., vision transformers), and recent vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) in the agriculture domain, focusing on diverse tasks such as crop disease detection, livestock health management, and aquatic species monitoring. We further cover major implementation challenges such as data variability and experimental aspects: datasets, performance evaluation metrics, and geographical focus.

Whereas a multitude of works address either the detection or mitigation of such shortcut behavior in isolation, the Reveal2Revise approach provides a comprehensive bias mitigation framework combining these steps. However, effectively addressing these biases often requires substantial labeling efforts from domain experts. In this work, we review the steps of the Reveal2Revise framework and enhance it with semi-automated interpretability-based bias annotation capabilities. This includes methods for the sample- and feature-level bias annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of the framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.

Data-free quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored. Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose \textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore, it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages,9 figuers | None |
| **[MedViT V2: Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13693v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings.

Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a language model and a simple vision transformer.</p></details> | Initial version | None |

Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative Pre-training for Subjective Tasks: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Framework for Facial Beauty Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20363v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification (e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP, sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for subjective visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and State-Space Model (SSM) architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

Adding to that success, transformer architecture has found widespread interest from computer vision (CV) researchers and practitioners, allowing for many advancements in vision-related tasks and opening the door for multitask and multi-modal deep learning architectures that share the same principle of operation. One drawback to these architectures is their reliance on the scaled dot product attention mechanism with the softmax activation function, which is computationally expensive and requires large compute capabilities for both training and inference. This paper investigates substituting the MLP and attention mechanism usually adopted for transformer architecture with an architecture based on incorporating a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function structure with the aim of reducing the computational cost. The equalized experimental assessments conducted in this work show that the proposed modification with the targeted reductions in computational complexity offers competitive performance compared to the selected baseline architectures. The results are significantly in support of the aims of this work, in which the focus was to extensively utilize GLU-based MLPs, establishing a more efficient but capable alternative to the traditional MLP and the attention mechanism as the core component in the design of transformer architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation. Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer computational resources. This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands. We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage these properties to better distill model knowledge. These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to become smaller, faster, and cheaper.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis | None |

Existing calibration methods typically post-process model outputs without interrogating the internal consistency of the predictions themselves. In this work, we introduce a novel, non-parametric statistical probe, the Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, that examines the internal consistency of a classifier's logits. The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a frequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1 contests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated softmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this simple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs), the BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving near-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a temperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's predictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional metrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new diagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular architectures represent uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

MTCAE-DFER builds a plug-and-play cascaded decoder module, which is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and employs the decoder concept of Transformer to reconstruct the multi-head attention module. The decoder output from the previous task serves as the query (Q), representing local dynamic features, while the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) shared encoder output acts as both the key (K) and value (V), representing global dynamic features. This setup facilitates interaction between global and local dynamic features across related tasks. Additionally, this proposal aims to alleviate overfitting of complex large model. We utilize autoencoder-based multi-task cascaded learning approach to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on dynamic facial expression recognition, which enhances the model's generalization ability. After we conduct extensive ablation experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition, the robustness of the MTCAE-DFER model and the effectiveness of global-local dynamic feature interaction among related tasks have been proven.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready Version, Accepted by IJCB 2025</p></details> | None |

Deep learning integration into structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO, CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias (spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention, resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves, particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture and function.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[Unraveling the geometry of visual relational reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17382v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing "constant" in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle, limiting their flexible reasoning. To investigate mechanisms underlying such generalization, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematically evaluating abstract relational reasoning, addressing limitations in prior datasets. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to quantify relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four models, ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL), we find that SCL generalizes best and most closely aligns with human behavior. Using a geometric approach, we identify key representation properties that accurately predict generalization and uncover a fundamental trade-off between signal and dimensionality: novel relations compress into training-induced subspaces. Layer-wise analysis reveals where relational structure emerges, highlights bottlenecks, and generates concrete hypotheses about abstract reasoning in the brain. Motivated by these insights, we propose SNRloss, a novel objective explicitly balancing representation geometry. Our results establish a geometric foundation for relational reasoning, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI and opening promising avenues for extending geometric analysis to broader cognitive tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures, 8 SI figures, 2 SI tables</p></details> | None |
| **[VENENA: A Deceptive Visual Encryption Framework for Wireless Semantic Secrecy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10699v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eavesdropping has been a long-standing threat to the security and privacy of wireless communications, since it is difficult to detect and costly to prevent. As networks evolve towards Sixth Generation (6G) and semantic communication becomes increasingly central to next-generation wireless systems, securing semantic information transmission emerges as a critical challenge. While classical physical layer security (PLS) focuses on passive security, the recently proposed concept of physical layer deception (PLD) offers a semantic encryption measure to actively deceive eavesdroppers. Yet the existing studies of PLD have been dominantly information-theoretical and link-level oriented, lacking considerations of system-level design and practical implementation. In this work we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled framework called Visual ENcryption for Eavesdropping NegAtion (VENENA), which combines the techniques of PLD, visual encryption, and image poisoning, into a comprehensive mechanism for deceptive secure semantic transmission in future wireless networks. By leveraging advanced vision transformers and semantic codecs, VENENA demonstrates how semantic security can be enhanced through the synergy of physical layer techniques and artificial intelligence, paving the way for secure semantic communication in 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE WCM</p></details> | None |

However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads, embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT.

| **[Patch Pruning Strategy Based on Robust Statistical Measures of Attention Weight Diversity in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19175v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning, which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance. Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that utilize all patches.</p></details> |  | None |

For a given uniform-bit quantization configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT, MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

Traditional approaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or conventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in scalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as improved handling of long-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This review explores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering a range of tasks. We begin by introducing the foundational architecture of ViTs and discussing their transition from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Computer Vision. The discussion includes the concept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive review of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and performance metrics. This study also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs and ViTs, along with a review of hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical challenges such as data requirements, computational demands, and model interpretability are addressed, along with potential solutions. Finally, we outline future research directions and technological advancements that could further support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings. Our goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper understanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision agriculture.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder. We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and generalization across vision-language domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures | None |

Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored, particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures | None |

| **[CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts. Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings" before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas. Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2) introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance. Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models. Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment with minimal labeled supervision.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Beyond Single-Channel: Multichannel Signal Imaging for PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction with Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21767v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

Token reduction, which discards less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks. Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks, tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing (ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

The process starts with a small set of manually annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when accurate ground truth is unavailable.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism, playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network. Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens. Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors.

These fused representations are used to continuously adjust two critical gait parameters (step height and hip splay), enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. To generate terrain representations, we process visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The Cross Attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for informed gait adaptation. This fused representation allows CROSS-GAiT to continuously adjust gait parameters in response to unpredictable terrain conditions in real-time. We train CROSS-GAiT on a diverse set of terrains including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand and validate its generalization ability on unseen environments. Our hardware implementation on the Ghost Robotics Vision 60 demonstrates superior performance in challenging terrains, such as high-density vegetation, unstable surfaces, sandbanks, and deformable substrates. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios. Additionally, the learned representations perform 4.48% better than the state-of-the-art on a terrain classification task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FOCUS: Fused Observation of Channels for Unveiling Spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14787v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15 percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enabling Efficient Hardware Acceleration of Hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) Networks at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14651v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid vision transformers combine the elements of conventional neural networks (NN) and vision transformers (ViT) to enable lightweight and accurate detection. However, several challenges remain for their efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. The hybrid models suffer from a widely diverse set of NN layer types and large intermediate data tensors, hampering efficient hardware acceleration. To enable their execution at the edge, this paper proposes innovations across the hardware-scheduling stack: a.) At the lowest level, a configurable PE array supports all hybrid ViT layer types; b.) temporal loop re-ordering within one layer, enabling hardware support for normalization and softmax layers, minimizing on-chip data transfers; c.) further scheduling optimization employs layer fusion across inverted bottleneck layers to drastically reduce off-chip memory transfers. The resulting accelerator is implemented in 28nm CMOS, achieving a peak energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W at 25.6 GMACs/s.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer. Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW. The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%, respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for practical facial expression recognition applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DFQ-ViT: Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers without Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14481v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers (ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT). Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty, effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sports Re-ID: Improving Re-Identification Of Players In Broadcast Videos Of Team Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02373v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on player re-identification in broadcast videos of team sports. Specifically, we focus on identifying the same player in images captured from different camera viewpoints during any given moment of a match. This task differs from traditional applications of person re-id in a few important ways. Firstly, players from the same team wear highly similar clothes, thereby making it harder to tell them apart. Secondly, there are only a few number of samples for each identity, which makes it harder to train a re-id system. Thirdly, the resolutions of the images are often quite low and vary a lot. This combined with heavy occlusions and fast movements of players greatly increase the challenges for re-id. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective hierarchical data sampling procedure and a centroid loss function that, when used together, increase the mean average precision (mAP) by 7 - 11.5 and the rank-1 (R1) by 8.8 - 14.9 without any change in the network or hyper-parameters used. Our data sampling procedure improves the similarity of the training and test distributions, and thereby aids in creating better estimates of the centroids of the embeddings (or feature vectors). Surprisingly, our study shows that in the presence of severely limited data, as is the case for our application, a simple centroid loss function based on euclidean distances significantly outperforms the popular triplet-centroid loss function. We show comparable improvements for both convolutional networks and vision transformers. Our approach is among the top ranked methods in the SoccerNet Re-Identification Challenge 2022 leaderboard (test-split) with a mAP of 86.0 and a R1 of 81.5. On the sequestered challenge split, we achieve an mAP of 84.9 and a R1 of 80.1. Research on re-id for sports-related applications is very limited and our work presents one of the first discussions in the literature on this.</p></details> |  | None |

However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76% misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more difficult to detect.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-free Token Reduction for Vision Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14042v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet performance without retraining.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> | None |

Yet, their application to music information retrieval (MIR) faces a dilemma: the former is more effective on tagging (e.g., instrument recognition) but less effective on structured prediction (e.g., tonality estimation); The latter can match supervised methods on the specific task it is designed for, but it does not generalize well to other tasks. In this article, we adopt a best-of-both-worlds approach by training a deep neural network on both kinds of pretext tasks at once. The proposed new architecture is a Vision Transformer with 1-D spectrogram patches (ViT-1D), equipped with two class tokens, which are specialized to different self-supervised pretext tasks but optimized through the same model: hence the qualification of self-supervised multi-class-token multitask (MT2). The former class token optimizes cross-power spectral density (CPSD) for equivariant learning over the circle of fifths, while the latter optimizes normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent) for contrastive learning. MT2 combines the strengths of both pretext tasks and outperforms consistently both single-class-token ViT-1D models trained with either contrastive or equivariant learning. Averaging the two class tokens further improves performance on several tasks, highlighting the complementary nature of the representations learned by each class token. Furthermore, using the same single-linear-layer probing method on the features of last layer, MT2 outperforms MERT on all tasks except for beat tracking; achieving this with 18x fewer parameters thanks to its multitasking capabilities. Our SSL benchmark demonstrates the versatility of our multi-class-token multitask learning approach for MIR applications.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE) module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization across multiple datasets.

We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures | None |

Recent efforts have integrated transformer blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner, ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their substantial compute and memory demands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and bandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose OptoViT, the first near-sensor, region-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time and energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid electronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles compute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and normalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and patch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet) that identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant patches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using quantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic constraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture co-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that OptoViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6% accuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the edge.</p></details> |  | None |

Continuous maritime ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations, we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS, which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs, ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features.

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revised abstract; added statistical analysis; one figure removed, three tables added; clarification of dataset usage, experimental design, and model training strategy; revised methods with details; revised discussion; defined all abbreviations; correction of typographical and numerical inconsistencies; overall language review</p></details> | None |

| **[Unit-Based Histopathology Tissue Segmentation via Multi-Level Feature Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12427v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02572v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 main-track paper (42nd International Conference on Machine Learning).
