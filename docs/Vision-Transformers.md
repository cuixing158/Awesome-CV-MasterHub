| **[A Deep Learning-Driven Inhalation Injury Grading Assistant Using Bronchoscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08517v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inhalation injuries present a challenge in clinical diagnosis and grading due to Conventional grading methods such as the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) being subjective and lacking robust correlation with clinical parameters like mechanical ventilation duration and patient mortality. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based diagnosis assistant tool for grading inhalation injuries using bronchoscopy images to overcome subjective variability and enhance consistency in severity assessment. Our approach leverages data augmentation techniques, including graphic transformations, Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT), and CycleGAN, to address the scarcity of medical imaging data. We evaluate the classification performance of two deep learning models, GoogLeNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), across a dataset significantly expanded through these augmentation methods. The results demonstrate GoogLeNet combined with CUT as the most effective configuration for grading inhalation injuries through bronchoscopy images and achieves a classification accuracy of 97.8%. The histograms and frequency analysis evaluations reveal variations caused by the augmentation CUT with distribution changes in the histogram and texture details of the frequency spectrum. PCA visualizations underscore the CUT substantially enhances class separability in the feature space. Moreover, Grad-CAM analyses provide insight into the decision-making process; mean intensity for CUT heatmaps is 119.6, which significantly exceeds 98.8 of the original datasets. Our proposed tool leverages mechanical ventilation periods as a novel grading standard, providing comprehensive diagnostic support.</p></details> |  | None |

Monitoring the distribution and abundance of seagrass is essential for environmental impact assessments and conservation efforts. However, the current manual methods of analyzing underwater video data to assess seagrass coverage are time-consuming and subjective. This work explores the use of deep learning models to automate the process of seagrass detection and coverage estimation from underwater video data. We create a new dataset of over 8,300 annotated underwater images, and subsequently evaluate several deep learning architectures, including ResNet, InceptionNetV3, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer for the task of binary classification on the presence and absence of seagrass by transfer learning. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly Vision Transformers, can achieve high performance in predicting eelgrass presence, with AUROC scores exceeding 0.95 on the final test dataset. The application of underwater image enhancement further improved the models' prediction capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach for estimating seagrass coverage from video data, showing promising preliminary results that align with expert manual labels, and indicating potential for consistent and scalable monitoring. The proposed methodology allows for the efficient processing of large volumes of video data, enabling the acquisition of much more detailed information on seagrass distributions in comparison to current manual methods. This information is crucial for environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs, as seagrasses are important indicators of coastal ecosystem health. This project demonstrates the value that deep learning can bring to the field of marine ecology and environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Charm: The Missing Piece in ViT fine-tuning for Image Aesthetic Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02522v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capacity of Vision transformers (ViTs) to handle variable-sized inputs is often constrained by computational complexity and batch processing limitations. Consequently, ViTs are typically trained on small, fixed-size images obtained through downscaling or cropping. While reducing computational burden, these methods result in significant information loss, negatively affecting tasks like image aesthetic assessment. We introduce Charm, a novel tokenization approach that preserves Composition, High-resolution, Aspect Ratio, and Multi-scale information simultaneously. Charm prioritizes high-resolution details in specific regions while downscaling others, enabling shorter fixed-size input sequences for ViTs while incorporating essential information. Charm is designed to be compatible with pre-trained ViTs and their learned positional embeddings. By providing multiscale input and introducing variety to input tokens, Charm improves ViT performance and generalizability for image aesthetic assessment. We avoid cropping or changing the aspect ratio to further preserve information. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements on various image aesthetic and quality assessment datasets (up to 8.1 %) using a lightweight ViT backbone. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/FBehrad/Charm.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/FBehrad/Charm) |
| **[A 2D Semantic-Aware Position Encoding for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09466v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization, translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance, and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant patches. By integrating $\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving performance on computer vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Supervised Deep Learning: A Comparative Study on CT-Based Intracranial Hemorrhage Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09252v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Real-time Capable Learning-based Visual Tool Pose Correction via Differentiable Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08875v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy in Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) has the potential to reduce surgeon cognitive and task load, thereby increasing procedural efficiency. However, implementing accurate autonomous control can be difficult due to poor end-effector proprioception, a limitation of their cable-driven mechanisms. Although the robot may have joint encoders for the end-effector pose calculation, various non-idealities make the entire kinematics chain inaccurate. Modern vision-based pose estimation methods lack real-time capability or can be hard to train and generalize. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time capable, vision transformer-based pose estimation approach that is trained using end-to-end differentiable kinematics and rendering in simulation. We demonstrate the potential of this method to correct for noisy pose estimates in simulation, with the longer term goal of verifying the sim-to-real transferability of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GPTAQ: Efficient Finetuning-Free Quantization for Asymmetric Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02692v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GPTAQ, a novel finetuning-free quantization method for compressing large-scale transformer architectures. Unlike the previous GPTQ method, which independently calibrates each layer, we always match the quantized layer's output to the exact output in the full-precision model, resulting in a scheme that we call asymmetric calibration. Such a scheme can effectively reduce the quantization error accumulated in previous layers. We analyze this problem using optimal brain compression to derive a close-formed solution. The new solution explicitly minimizes the quantization error as well as the accumulated asymmetry error. Furthermore, we utilize various techniques to parallelize the solution calculation, including channel parallelization, neuron decomposition, and Cholesky reformulation for matrix fusion. As a result, GPTAQ is easy to implement, simply using 20 more lines of code than GPTQ but improving its performance under low-bit quantization. Remarkably, on a single GPU, we quantize a 405B language transformer as well as EVA-02, the rank first vision transformer that achieves 90% pretraining Imagenet accuracy. Code is available at Github.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | None |
| **[Ultrasound Report Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models for Standardized Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08838v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages. Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores, approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TiMo: Spatiotemporal Foundation Model for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08723v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations. Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo, enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo) |
| **[VIViT: Variable-Input Vision Transformer Framework for 3D MR Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08693v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[CNN and ViT Efficiency Study on Tiny ImageNet and DermaMNIST Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08259v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates the trade-offs between convolutional and transformer-based architectures on both medical and general-purpose image classification benchmarks. We use ResNet-18 as our baseline and introduce a fine-tuning strategy applied to four Vision Transformer variants (Tiny, Small, Base, Large) on DermatologyMNIST and TinyImageNet. Our goal is to reduce inference latency and model complexity with acceptable accuracy degradation. Through systematic hyperparameter variations, we demonstrate that appropriately fine-tuned Vision Transformers can match or exceed the baseline's performance, achieve faster inference, and operate with fewer parameters, highlighting their viability for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Empowering Vision Transformers with Multi-Scale Causal Intervention for Long-Tailed Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08173v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sleep Position Classification using Transfer Learning for Bed-based Pressure Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08111v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bed-based pressure-sensitive mats (PSMs) offer a non-intrusive way of monitoring patients during sleep. We focus on four-way sleep position classification using data collected from a PSM placed under a mattress in a sleep clinic. Sleep positions can affect sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as apnea. Measurements were performed on patients with suspected sleep disorders referred for assessments at a sleep clinic. Training deep learning models can be challenging in clinical settings due to the need for large amounts of labeled data. To overcome the shortage of labeled training data, we utilize transfer learning to adapt pre-trained deep learning models to accurately estimate sleep positions from a low-resolution PSM dataset collected in a polysomnography sleep lab. Our approach leverages Vision Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet using masked autoencoding (ViTMAE) and a pre-trained model for human pose estimation (ViTPose). These approaches outperform previous work from PSM-based sleep pose classification using deep learning (TCN) as well as traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) that use engineered features. We evaluate the performance of sleep position classification from 112 nights of patient recordings and validate it on a higher resolution 13-patient dataset. Despite the challenges of differentiating between sleep positions from low-resolution PSM data, our approach shows promise for real-world deployment in clinical settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference publication submitted to IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LAMM-ViT: AI Face Detection via Layer-Aware Modulation of Region-Guided Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07734v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to capture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across diverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation (LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle, hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45% improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Spiking Vision Transformer for Object Detection with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07715v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer parameters.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hierarchical Sparse Attention Framework for Computationally Efficient Classification of Biological Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07661v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model, allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images, we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD) images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities, SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers. Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput settings, including imaging flow cytometry.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Breast Cancer Classification in Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Images Using a Patch-Level Vision Transformer Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07654v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment is essential to achieve a balance between thorough cancer resection and tissue conservation. A deep ultraviolet fluorescence scanning microscope (DUV-FSM) enables rapid acquisition of whole surface images (WSIs) for excised tissue, providing contrast between malignant and normal tissues. However, breast cancer classification with DUV WSIs is challenged by high resolutions and complex histopathological features. This study introduces a DUV WSI classification framework using a patch-level vision transformer (ViT) model, capturing local and global features. Grad-CAM++ saliency weighting highlights relevant spatial regions, enhances result interpretability, and improves diagnostic accuracy for benign and malignant tissue classification. A comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation demonstrates the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.33%.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), achieve state-of-the-art performance using user clicks and prior masks as prompts. However, existing methods treat interactions as independent events, leading to redundant corrections and limited refinement gains. We address this by introducing MAIS, a Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration. Our approach enhances ViT-based segmentation across diverse imaging modalities, achieving more efficient and accurate refinements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Plane Vision Transformer for Hemorrhage Classification Using Axial and Sagittal MRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07349v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying brain hemorrhages from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical task for healthcare professionals. The diverse nature of MRI acquisitions with varying contrasts and orientation introduce complexity in identifying hemorrhage using neural networks. For acquisitions with varying orientations, traditional methods often involve resampling images to a fixed plane, which can lead to information loss. To address this, we propose a 3D multi-plane vision transformer (MP-ViT) for hemorrhage classification with varying orientation data. It employs two separate transformer encoders for axial and sagittal contrasts, using cross-attention to integrate information across orientations. MP-ViT also includes a modality indication vector to provide missing contrast information to the model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experiments on real world clinical dataset consists of 10,084 training, 1,289 validation and 1,496 test subjects. MP-ViT achieved substantial improvement in area under the curve (AUC), outperforming the vision transformer (ViT) by 5.5% and CNN-based architectures by 1.8%. These results highlight the potential of MP-ViT in improving performance for hemorrhage detection when different orientation contrasts are needed.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

We evaluate our method through a zero-shot classification task for hematoma detection in brain imaging.

We address this issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex, which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally, in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain image classification tasks.

However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TGBFormer: Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network for Video Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13903v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset.

Integrative Skill Development on Complex Trails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06218v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Slot Interpreters: Grounding Object Semantics in Emergent Slot Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07887v4)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several accounts of human cognition posit that our intelligence is rooted in our ability to form abstract composable concepts, ground them in our environment, and reason over these grounded entities. This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is a nested schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the downstream efficacy of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Most state-of-the-art trackers struggle to meet real-time processing demands on mobile platforms with constrained computing resources, particularly for real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. To achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency, we introduce AVTrack, an adaptive computation framework designed to selectively activate transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The proposed Activation Module (AM) dynamically optimizes the ViT architecture by selectively engaging relevant components, thereby enhancing inference efficiency without significant compromise to tracking performance. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges posed by extreme changes in viewing angles often encountered in UAV tracking, the proposed method enhances ViTs' effectiveness by learning view-invariant representations through mutual information (MI) maximization. Two effective design principles are proposed in the AVTrack. Building on it, we propose an improved tracker, dubbed AVTrack-MD, which introduces the novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MD) framework. It harnesses the benefits of multiple teachers, specifically the off-the-shelf tracking models from the AVTrack, by integrating and refining their outputs, thereby guiding the learning process of the compact student network. Specifically, we maximize the MI between the softened feature representations from the multi-teacher models and the student model, leading to improved generalization and performance of the student model, particularly in noisy conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that AVTrack-MD not only achieves performance comparable to the AVTrack baseline but also reduces model complexity, resulting in a significant 17\% increase in average tracking speed.</p></details> |  | None |

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures | None |

| **[Pose Estimation for Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Catheter via AI-Based Anatomical Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07851v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However, existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of 851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16 embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98 deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy. Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and 92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98 to 0.99 against observation data.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures</p></details> | None |

However, the high computational requirements of these models limit their practical applicability especially on low-power devices. Current state-of-the-art employs approximate multipliers to address the highly increased compute demands of DNN accelerators but no prior research has explored their use on ViT models. In this work we propose TransAxx, a framework based on the popular PyTorch library that enables fast inherent support for approximate arithmetic to seamlessly evaluate the impact of approximate computing on DNNs such as ViT models. Using TransAxx we analyze the sensitivity of transformer models on the ImageNet dataset to approximate multiplications and perform approximate-aware finetuning to regain accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a methodology to generate approximate accelerators for ViT models. Our approach uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to efficiently search the space of possible configurations using a hardware-driven hand-crafted policy. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our methodology in achieving significant trade-offs between accuracy and power, resulting in substantial gains without compromising on performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.</p></details> |  | None |

Still, the impact of model size on the performance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under label noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of transformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under low-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy and calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning settings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large with 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations (Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label noise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular) consistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and calibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers exhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch sizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently worse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find that information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful accuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer calibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially at high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance for practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained environments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute efficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Navigating Neural Space: Revisiting Concept Activation Vectors to Overcome Directional Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03482v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local, global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds that predict the strict ordering $CNN<ViT<Hybrid<Capsule$. Controlled experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward, embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

While current methods have shown promise in accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV.

Despite the promising performance of existing methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), they often struggle to align closely with human perceptions, particularly in diverse real-world scenarios. This challenge is exacerbated by the limited scale and diversity of available datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel VQA framework, DiffVQA, which harnesses the robust generalization capabilities of diffusion models pre-trained on extensive datasets. Our framework adapts these models to reconstruct identical input frames through a control module. The adapted diffusion model is then used to extract semantic and distortion features from a resizing branch and a cropping branch, respectively. To enhance the model's ability to handle long-term temporal dynamics, a parallel Mamba module is introduced, which extracts temporal coherence augmented features that are merged with the diffusion features to predict the final score. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate DiffVQA's superior performance on intra-dataset evaluations and its exceptional generalization across datasets. These results confirm that leveraging a diffusion model as a feature extractor can offer enhanced VQA performance compared to CNN and ViT backbones.</p></details> |  | None |

Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g. those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths, and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality, low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Token Coordinated Prompt Attention is Needed for Visual Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02406v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompting techniques are widely used to efficiently fine-tune pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) by learning a small set of shared prompts for all tokens. However, existing methods overlook the unique roles of different tokens in conveying discriminative information and interact with all tokens using the same prompts, thereby limiting the representational capacity of ViT. This often leads to indistinguishable and biased prompt-extracted features, hindering performance. To address this issue, we propose a plug-and-play Token Coordinated Prompt Attention (TCPA) module, which assigns specific coordinated prompts to different tokens for attention-based interactions. Firstly, recognizing the distinct functions of CLS and image tokens-global information aggregation and local feature extraction, we disentangle the prompts into CLS Prompts and Image Prompts, which interact exclusively with CLS tokens and image tokens through attention mechanisms. This enhances their respective discriminative abilities. Furthermore, as different image tokens correspond to distinct image patches and contain diverse information, we employ a matching function to automatically assign coordinated prompts to individual tokens. This enables more precise attention interactions, improving the diversity and representational capacity of the extracted features. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that TCPA significantly enhances the diversity and discriminative power of the extracted features. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-TCPA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-TCPA) |
| **[Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

Current deepfake detection techniques have evolved from CNN-based methods focused on local artifacts to more advanced approaches using vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP, which capture global anomalies and improve cross-domain generalization. Despite recent progress, state-of-the-art deepfake detectors still face major challenges in handling distribution shifts from emerging generative models and addressing severe class imbalance between authentic and fake samples in deepfake datasets, which limits their robustness and detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that combines dynamic loss reweighting and ranking-based optimization, which achieves superior generalization and performance under imbalanced dataset conditions.

| **[Always Skip Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01996v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.</p></details> |  | None |

A solution to the challenge is effective space object detection (SOD) for collision assessment and avoidance. In SOD, an LEO satellite must detect other satellites and objects with high precision and minimal delay. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing vision sensors for SOD tasks based on deep learning (DL) models. It introduces models based on the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and evaluates their performance under SOD scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieve mean average precision at intersection over union threshold 0.5 (mAP50) scores of up to 0.751 and mean average precision averaged over intersection over union thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50:95) scores of up to 0.280. Compared to the baseline GELAN-t model, the proposed GELAN-ViT-SE model increases the average mAP50 from 0.721 to 0.751, improves the mAP50:95 from 0.266 to 0.274, reduces giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) from 7.3 to 5.6, and lowers peak power consumption from 2080.7 mW to 2028.7 mW by 2.5\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 18th International Conference on Space Operations (SpaceOps 2025)</p></details> | None |

The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.</p></details> |  | None |

In computer vision, the attention mechanism was first incorporated in the Vision Transformer ViT, and then its usage has expanded into many tasks in the vision domain, such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and image generation. While the attention mechanism is very expressive and capable, it comes with the disadvantage of being computationally expensive and requiring datasets of considerable size for effective optimization. To address these shortcomings, many designs have been proposed in the literature to reduce the computational burden and alleviate the data size requirements. Examples of such attempts in the vision domain are the MLP-Mixer, the Conv-Mixer, the Perciver-IO, and many more attempts with different sets of advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a new computational block as an alternative to the standard ViT block. The newly proposed block reduces the computational requirements by replacing the normal attention layers with a Network in Network structure, therefore enhancing the static approach of the MLP-Mixer with a dynamic learning of element-wise gating function generated by a token mixing process. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed design provides better performance than the baseline architectures on multiple datasets applied in the image classification task of the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Comput & Applic (2025)</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches either rely on light enhancers with high computational costs or introduce redundant domain adaptation mechanisms, failing to fully utilize the dynamic features in varying perspectives. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DARTer} (\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{T}racker), an end-to-end tracking framework designed for nighttime UAV scenarios. DARTer leverages a Dynamic Feature Blender (DFB) to effectively fuse multi-perspective nighttime features from static and dynamic templates, enhancing representation robustness. Meanwhile, a Dynamic Feature Activator (DFA) adaptively activates Vision Transformer layers based on extracted features, significantly improving efficiency by reducing redundant computations. Our model eliminates the need for complex multi-task loss functions, enabling a streamlined training process. Extensive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DARTer over state-of-the-art trackers. These results confirm that DARTer effectively balances tracking accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world nighttime UAV tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> | None |

State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture, have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing about 120 studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and applications.

To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry.

| **[Interpretability-Aware Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08035v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become prominent models for solving various vision tasks. However, the interpretability of ViTs has not kept pace with their promising performance. While there has been a surge of interest in developing {\it post hoc} solutions to explain ViTs' outputs, these methods do not generalize to different downstream tasks and various transformer architectures. Furthermore, if ViTs are not properly trained with the given data and do not prioritize the region of interest, the {\it post hoc} methods would be less effective. Instead of developing another {\it post hoc} approach, we introduce a novel training procedure that inherently enhances model interpretability. Our interpretability-aware ViT (IA-ViT) draws inspiration from a fresh insight: both the class patch and image patches consistently generate predicted distributions and attention maps. IA-ViT is composed of a feature extractor, a predictor, and an interpreter, which are trained jointly with an interpretability-aware training objective. Consequently, the interpreter simulates the behavior of the predictor and provides a faithful explanation through its single-head self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IA-ViT in several image classification tasks, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of model performance and interpretability.

This paper proposes a new approach for measuring confidence in the predictions of any neural network that relies on the predictions of a softmax layer. We identify that a high-accuracy trained network may have certain outputs for which there should be low confidence. In such cases, decisions should be deferred and it is more appropriate for the network to provide a \textit{not known} answer to a corresponding classification task. Our approach clusters the vectors in the softmax layer to measure distances between cluster centroids and network outputs. We show that a cluster with centroid calculated simply as the mean softmax output for all correct predictions can serve as a suitable proxy in the evaluation of confidence. Defining a distance threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid offers a simple approach to adding \textit{not known} answers to any network classification falling outside of the threshold. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across datasets and network models, and indicate that the proposed distance metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 2 table</p></details> | None |

Existing underwater image enhancement methods often treat the haze and color cast as a unified degradation process, neglecting their inherent independence while overlooking their synergistic relationship. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based network (referred to as WaterFormer) to improve underwater image quality. WaterFormer contains three major components: a dehazing block (DehazeFormer Block) to capture the self-correlated haze features and extract deep-level features, a Color Restoration Block (CRB) to capture self-correlated color cast features, and a Channel Fusion Block (CFB) that dynamically integrates these decoupled features to achieve comprehensive enhancement. To ensure authenticity, a soft reconstruction layer based on the underwater imaging physics model is included. Further, a Chromatic Consistency Loss and Sobel Color Loss are designed to respectively preserve color fidelity and enhance structural details during network training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that WaterFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in enhancing underwater images.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Modeling and Performance Analysis for Semantic Communications Based on Empirical Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21055v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[SNR-aware Semantic Image Transmission with Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation in Fading Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20557v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communications (SCs) play a central role in shaping the future of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, which leverage rapid advances in deep learning (DL). In this regard, end-to-end optimized DL-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been adopted to achieve SCs, particularly in image transmission. Utilizing vision transformers in the encoder/decoder design has enabled significant advancements in image semantic extraction, surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a new JSCC paradigm for image transmission, namely Swin semantic image transmission (SwinSIT), based on the Swin transformer. The Swin transformer is employed to construct both the semantic encoder and decoder for efficient image semantic extraction and reconstruction. Inspired by the squeezing-and-excitation (SE) network, we introduce a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-aware module that utilizes SNR feedback to adaptively perform a double-phase enhancement for the encoder-extracted semantic map and its noisy version at the decoder. Additionally, a CNN-based channel estimator and compensator (CEAC) module repurposes an image-denoising CNN to mitigate fading channel effects. To optimize deployment in resource-constrained IoT devices, a joint pruning and quantization scheme compresses the SwinSIT model. Simulations evaluate the SwinSIT performance against conventional benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, the model's compressed version substantially reduces its size while maintaining favorable PSNR performance.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[GMAR: Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout for Vision Transformer Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19414v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer vision, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Its architectural flexibility and capabilities have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However, the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful." Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at The 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Pulmonary nodules, often early indicators of lung cancer, necessitate accurate, timely diagnosis. Despite Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) advances, many existing systems struggle providing clear, comprehensive explanations, especially with limited labelled data. This study introduces MERA, a Multimodal and Multiscale self-Explanatory model designed for lung nodule diagnosis with considerably Reduced Annotation requirements. MERA integrates unsupervised and weakly supervised learning strategies (self-supervised learning techniques and Vision Transformer architecture for unsupervised feature extraction) and a hierarchical prediction mechanism leveraging sparse annotations via semi-supervised active learning in the learned latent space. MERA explains its decisions on multiple levels: model-level global explanations via semantic latent space clustering, instance-level case-based explanations showing similar instances, local visual explanations via attention maps, and concept explanations using critical nodule attributes. Evaluations on the public LIDC dataset show MERA's superior diagnostic accuracy and self-explainability. With only 1% annotated samples, MERA achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art methods requiring full annotation. The model's inherent design delivers comprehensive, robust, multilevel explanations aligned closely with clinical practice, enhancing trustworthiness and transparency. Demonstrated viability of unsupervised and weakly supervised learning lowers the barrier to deploying diagnostic AI in broader medical domains.

However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead. We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range. TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) 2025</p></details> | None |

These challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments, including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.</p></details> |  | None |

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

| **[Brain Tumor Identification using Improved YOLOv8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03746v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.</p></details> |  | None |

The approach involves feature extraction from .pcap files and transforming each instance into a 1-channel 2D image shape, enabling ViT-based classification. Also, the ViT model was enhanced to allow use any classifier besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that was deployed in the initial ViT paper.

Comprising a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves with unique coat patterns and 900 static frames, the dataset emphasizes real-world challenges like prolonged occlusions, motion blur, and pose variation. By fine-tuning 28 object detectors (YOLO variants, transformers) and evaluating 23 pretrained backbones (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs), we expose critical architectural trade-offs: smaller models (e.g., ConvNextV2 Nano, 15.6M parameters) excel in efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while pure vision transformers lag in occlusion-heavy settings. The dataset's structured design-fixed camera views, natural motion, and verified identities-provides a reproducible testbed for object detection challenges (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), bridging synthetic simplicity and domain-specific complexity.

However, extending VLMs to 3D imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs often rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, or on 3D convolutions, which require large numbers of parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along the depth, height, and width dimensions. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is trained and evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports. In zero-shot and fine-tuned detection of 18 pathologies, as well as in image-text retrieval tasks, DCFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D vision encoders, including CT-ViT, ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/DCFormer.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/mirthAI/DCFormer) |

In particular, it is challenging to transfer large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks defined on small tabular datasets. To address this, we propose VisTabNet -- a cross-modal transfer learning method, which allows for adapting Vision Transformer (ViT) with pre-trained weights to process tabular data. By projecting tabular inputs to patch embeddings acceptable by ViT, we can directly apply a pre-trained Transformer Encoder to tabular inputs. This approach eliminates the conceptual cost of designing a suitable architecture for processing tabular data, while reducing the computational cost of training the model from scratch. Experimental results on multiple small tabular datasets (less than 1k samples) demonstrate VisTabNet's superiority, outperforming both traditional ensemble methods and recent deep learning models. The proposed method goes beyond conventional transfer learning practice and shows that pre-trained image models can be transferred to solve tabular problems, extending the boundaries of transfer learning. We share our example implementation as a GitHub repository available at https://github.com/wwydmanski/VisTabNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/wwydmanski/VisTabNet) |

Nevertheless, deep learning methods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging research, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and difficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised learning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled data, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening the breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and substantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization characteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and applicability in many application scenarios. In this study, we employ nn-MobileNet, a lightweight CNN framework, to implement a BERT-style self-supervised learning approach. We pre-train the network on the unlabeled retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank to improve downstream application performance. We validate the results of the pre-trained model on Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and various retinal diseases identification. The results show that our approach can significantly improve performance in the downstream tasks. In summary, this study combines the benefits of CNNs with the capabilities of advanced self-supervised learning in handling large-scale unlabeled data, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in the presence of label scarcity.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing token pruning methods often overlook fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no architectural changes or additional training.

| **[Masked strategies for images with small objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17935v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood components is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.</p></details> |  | None |

Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at BMVC 2024.

Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

| **[Hyperspectral Vision Transformers for Greenhouse Gas Estimations from Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16851v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral information and holds significant potential for monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, its application is constrained by limited spatial coverage and infrequent revisit times. In contrast, multispectral imaging offers broader spatial and temporal coverage but often lacks the spectral detail that can enhance GHG detection. To address these challenges, this study proposes a spectral transformer model that synthesizes hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs. The model is pre-trained via a band-wise masked autoencoder and subsequently fine-tuned on spatio-temporally aligned multispectral-hyperspectral image pairs. The resulting synthetic hyperspectral data retain the spatial and temporal benefits of multispectral imagery and improve GHG prediction accuracy relative to using multispectral data alone. This approach effectively bridges the trade-off between spectral resolution and coverage, highlighting its potential to advance atmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and multispectral systems with self-supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a new image description generation model that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with cross-modal attention and a GPT-4-based transformer decoder. The ViT captures high-quality visual features from chest X-rays, which are fused with text data through cross-modal attention to improve the accuracy, context, and richness of image descriptions. The GPT-4 decoder transforms these fused features into accurate and relevant captions. The model was tested on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Indiana University (IU) Chest X-ray datasets. On the IU dataset, it achieved scores of 0.854 (B-1), 0.883 (CIDEr), 0.759 (METEOR), and 0.712 (ROUGE-L). On the NIH dataset, it achieved the best performance on all metrics: BLEU 1--4 (0.825, 0.788, 0.765, 0.752), CIDEr (0.857), METEOR (0.726), and ROUGE-L (0.705).

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved natural language processing and computer vision. In this work, we propose Tri-FusionNet, a novel image description generation model that integrates transformer modules: a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder module with dual-attention mechanism, a Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) decoder module, and a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) integrating module. The ViT encoder, enhanced with dual attention, focuses on relevant spatial regions and linguistic context, improving image feature extraction. The RoBERTa decoder is employed to generate precise textual descriptions. CLIP's integrating module aligns visual and textual data through contrastive learning, ensuring effective combination of both modalities. This fusion of ViT, RoBERTa, and CLIP, along with dual attention, enables the model to produce more accurate, contextually rich, and flexible descriptions. The proposed framework demonstrated competitive performance on the Flickr30k and Flickr8k datasets, with BLEU scores ranging from 0.767 to 0.456 and 0.784 to 0.479, CIDEr scores of 1.679 and 1.483, METEOR scores of 0.478 and 0.358, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.567 and 0.789, respectively. On MS-COCO, the framework obtained BLEU scores of 0.893 (B-1), 0.821 (B-2), 0.794 (B-3), and 0.725 (B-4). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Tri-FusionNet in generating high-quality image descriptions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Vision Transformer for Large-Scale Fine-Grained Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16691v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) aims to retrieve images belonging to the same subcategory as a given query by capturing subtle differences in a large-scale setting. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) have been employed in FGIR due to their powerful self-attention mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. However, most Transformer-based methods focus primarily on leveraging self-attention to distinguish fine-grained details, while overlooking the high computational complexity and redundant dependencies inherent to these models, limiting their scalability and effectiveness in large-scale FGIR. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Effective ViT-based framework, termed \textbf{EET}, which integrates token pruning module with a discriminative transfer strategy to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a content-based token pruning scheme to enhance the efficiency of the vanilla ViT, progressively removing background or low-discriminative tokens at different stages by exploiting feature responses and self-attention mechanism. To ensure the resulting efficient ViT retains strong discriminative power, we further present a discriminative transfer strategy comprising both \textit{discriminative knowledge transfer} and \textit{discriminative region guidance}. Using a distillation paradigm, these components transfer knowledge from a larger ``teacher'' ViT to a more efficient ``student'' model, guiding the latter to focus on subtle yet crucial regions in a cost-free manner. Extensive experiments on two widely-used fine-grained datasets and four large-scale fine-grained datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, EET reduces the inference latency of ViT-Small by 42.7\% and boosts the retrieval performance of 16-bit hash codes by 5.15\% on the challenging NABirds dataset.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM | None |

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to MEDIA</p></details> | None |

However, modality gaps and limited annotations present significant challenges. We propose a few-shot metric learning method with a dual-channel attention mechanism and a pretrained vision transformer to enable robust cross-modal neuron identification. The local and global channels extract soma morphology and fiber context, respectively, and a gating mechanism fuses their outputs. To enhance the model's fine-grained discrimination capability, we introduce a hard sample mining strategy based on the MultiSimilarityMiner algorithm, along with the Circle Loss function. Experiments on two-photon and fMOST datasets demonstrate superior Top-K accuracy and recall compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and t-SNE visualizations validate the effectiveness of each module. The method also achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising technical solution for accurate single-cell level matching and multimodal neuroimaging integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, submitted to arXiv for public access</p></details> | None |
| **[Quantum Doubly Stochastic Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16275v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often destabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, these models often lack interpretability and suffer from inefficiencies due to dense embedding representations. We propose SparseJEPA, an extension that integrates sparse representation learning into the JEPA framework to enhance the quality of learned representations. SparseJEPA employs a penalty method that encourages latent space variables to be shared among data features with strong semantic relationships, while maintaining predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseJEPA by training on the CIFAR-100 dataset and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer. The improved embeddings are utilized in linear-probe transfer learning for both image classification and low-level tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof that demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality. This was done by displaying that grouping reduces Multiinformation among latent-variables, including proofing the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. Our results indicate that incorporating sparsity not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations. In further work, hope to further extend this method by finding new ways to leverage the grouping mechanism through object-centric representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W).

Existing approaches to mitigate models' dependence on spurious features work in some cases, but fail in others. In this paper, we systematically analyze how and where neural networks encode spurious correlations. We introduce the neuron spurious score, an XAI-based diagnostic measure to quantify a neuron's dependence on spurious features. We analyze both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using architecture-specific methods. Our results show that spurious features are partially disentangled, but the degree of disentanglement varies across model architectures.

| **[Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16128v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a serious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large transformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease classification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their computational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them impractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as MobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the required spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically transfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a MobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive attention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution, channels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and spatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled MobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95% reduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU and 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric validation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching attention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over standalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over MobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time, energy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how we can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models will be made available for replication after acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages and 4 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | IEEE MCNA 2025 | None |

The process entails first segmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity of eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated eczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the severity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated data to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited training data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation, where we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot segmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and classification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and feed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of eczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated "in-the-wild" eczema images, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 $\pm$ 0.01) the state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted F1: 0.44 $\pm$ 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 $\pm$ 0.22).

This surge in IoT devices, along with their widespread presence, has made them a prime target for various cyber-attacks, particularly through IoT botnets. As a result, security has become a major concern within the IoT ecosystem. This study focuses on investigating how the latent dimension impacts the performance of different deep learning classifiers when trained on latent vector representations of the train dataset. The primary objective is to compare the outcomes of these models when encoder components from two cutting-edge architectures: the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are utilized to project the high dimensional train dataset to the learned low dimensional latent space. The encoder components are employed to project high-dimensional structured .csv IoT botnet traffic datasets to various latent sizes. Evaluated on N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022 datasets, findings reveal that VAE-encoder based dimension reduction outperforms ViT-encoder based dimension reduction for both datasets in terms of four performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all models which can be attributed to absence of spatial patterns in the datasets the ViT model attempts to learn and extract from image instances.</p></details> |  | None |

Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).</p></details> |  | None |

ECViT introduces inductive biases such as locality and translation invariance, inherent to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the Transformer framework by extracting patches from low-level features and enhancing the encoder with convolutional operations. Additionally, it incorporates local-attention and a pyramid structure to enable efficient multi-scale feature extraction and representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ECViT achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art models on various image classification tasks while maintaining low computational and storage requirements.

Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> | None |

It ranks among the top causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detecting lung cancer manually using chest X-Ray image or Computational Tomography (CT) scans image poses significant challenges for radiologists. Hence, there is a need for automatic diagnosis system of lung cancers from radiology images. With the recent emergence of deep learning, particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the automated detection of lung cancer has become a much simpler task. Nevertheless, numerous researchers have addressed that the performance of conventional CNNs may be hindered due to class imbalance issue, which is prevalent in medical images. In this research work, we have proposed a novel CNN architecture ``Multi-Scale Dense Network (MSD-Net)'' (trained-from-scratch). The novelties we bring in the proposed model are (I) We introduce novel dense modules in the 4th block and 5th block of the CNN model. We have leveraged 3 depthwise separable convolutional (DWSC) layers, and one 1x1 convolutional layer in each dense module, in order to reduce complexity of the model considerably. (II) Additionally, we have incorporated one skip connection from 3rd block to 5th block and one parallel branch connection from 4th block to Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer. We have utilized dilated convolutional layer (with dilation rate=2) in the last parallel branch in order to extract multi-scale features.

While absolute positional embeddings (APE) have shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE), particularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial inductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental challenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have mostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional embeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering method that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies, providing a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results show that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various ViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional embeddings, we introduce the "Three Cell Experiment", a novel benchmarking framework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute positional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard evaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models with and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference, offering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs. Our experimental analysis confirms that the proposed LOOPE demonstrates enhanced effectiveness in retaining both relative and absolute positional information.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach incorporates a valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module derived from Wav2Vec 2.0, a BERT text encoder, and a vision transformer (ViT) with predictions subsequently processed through a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture or a convolution-like method for temporal modeling. We integrate the textual and visual modality into our analysis, recognizing that semantic content provides valuable contextual cues and underscoring that the meaning of speech often conveys more critical insights than its acoustic counterpart alone. Fusing in the vision modality helps in some cases to interpret the textual modality more precisely. This combined approach results in significant performance improvements, achieving in EMI $\rho_{\text{TEST}} = 0.706$ and in BAH $F1_{\text{TEST}} = 0.702$, securing first place in the EMI challenge and second place in the BAH challenge.</p></details> |  | None |

Our proposed architecture combines a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads and incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This design promotes full parameter sharing across tasks, significantly reducing the computational and memory footprint without sacrificing performance. The model processes both image-like wireless modalities, such as spectrograms and channel state information (CSI), and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signals arranged as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) resource grids. We demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of WavesFM through extensive experiments on four downstream tasks: Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) positioning; multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) channel estimation; human activity sensing; and radio-frequency (RF) signal classification. Compared to supervised baselines trained individually, our approach achieves superior performance while sharing 80% of its parameters across tasks. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on domain-relevant data not only boosts performance but also accelerates convergence, reducing training time by up to 5x. These results demonstrate that our unified WFM can support diverse tasks and deliver significant gains in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of foundation models to drive AI-native paradigms in future sixth-generation (6G) networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Notably, in the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models, there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN (CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and subjective assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Modern hazard detection and response systems that deal with wildfires are under-equipped for sustained wildfire seasons. Recent work has proved automated wildfire detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on satellite imagery are capable of high-accuracy results. However, CNNs are computationally expensive to train and only incorporate local image context. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity for their efficient training and their ability to include both local and global contextual information. In this work, we show that ViT can outperform well-trained and specialized CNNs to detect wildfires on a previously published dataset of LandSat-8 imagery. One of our ViTs outperforms the baseline CNN comparison by 0.92%. However, we find our own implementation of CNN-based UNet to perform best in every category, showing their sustained utility in image tasks. Overall, ViTs are comparably capable in detecting wildfires as CNNs, though well-tuned CNNs are still the best technique for detecting wildfire with our UNet providing an IoU of 93.58%, better than the baseline UNet by some 4.58%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoding Vision Transformers: the Diffusion Steering Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13763v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures.

However, it struggles with the extraction of multi-scale local features, leading to limited performance in detecting small targets, especially when they are densely arranged. Therefore, we propose Density-Sensitive Vision Transformer with Adaptive Tokens (DenSe-AdViT) for dense SAR target detection. We design a Density-Aware Module (DAM) as a preliminary component that generates a density tensor based on target distribution. It is guided by a meticulously crafted objective metric, enabling precise and effective capture of the spatial distribution and density of objects. To integrate the multi-scale information enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global features derived from the Transformer, Density-Enhanced Fusion Module (DEFM) is proposed. It effectively refines attention toward target-survival regions with the assist of density mask and the multiple sources features. Notably, our DenSe-AdViT achieves 79.8% mAP on the RSDD dataset and 92.5% on the SIVED dataset, both of which feature a large number of densely distributed vehicle targets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Masked Capsule Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04724v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Masked Capsule Autoencoders (MCAE), the first Capsule Network that utilises pretraining in a modern self-supervised paradigm, specifically the masked image modelling framework. Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They have shown favourable properties when compared to Vision Transformers (ViT), but have struggled to effectively learn when presented with more complex data. This has led to Capsule Network models that do not scale to modern tasks. Our proposed MCAE model alleviates this issue by reformulating the Capsule Network to use masked image modelling as a pretraining stage before finetuning in a supervised manner. Across several experiments and ablations studies we demonstrate that similarly to CNNs and ViTs, Capsule Networks can also benefit from self-supervised pretraining, paving the way for further advancements in this neural network domain. For instance, by pretraining on the Imagenette dataset-consisting of 10 classes of Imagenet-sized images-we achieve state-of-the-art results for Capsule Networks, demonstrating a 9% improvement compared to our baseline model. Thus, we propose that Capsule Networks benefit from and should be trained within a masked image modelling framework, using a novel capsule decoder, to enhance a Capsule Network's performance on realistically sized images.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables - accepted at TMLR</p></details> | None |
| **[LoRA-Based Continual Learning with Constraints on Critical Parameter Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13407v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LoRA-based continual learning represents a promising avenue for leveraging pre-trained models in downstream continual learning tasks. Recent studies have shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However, this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known continual learning benchmarks. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100 dataset, our method shows a 6.35\% improvement in accuracy and a 3.24\% reduction in forgetting compared to previous methods.

However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.</p></details> |  | None |

Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at BMVC 2024.

However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of annotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object detection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in satellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of the technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise. Furthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of supervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we introduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based SAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an unlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\textsuperscript{2} ground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach capitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate objects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from the background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the disproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive sampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution during training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach allows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3 or UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such as DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark SAR datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 ML4RS https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ml-for-rs.github.io/iclr2025) |

We investigate human-aligned learned lossy compression as a defense mechanism, comparing two learned models (HiFiC and ELIC) against traditional JPEG across various quality levels. Our experiments on ImageNet subsets demonstrate that learned compression methods outperform JPEG, particularly for Vision Transformer architectures, by preserving semantically meaningful content while removing adversarial noise. Even in white-box settings where attackers can access the defense, these methods maintain substantial effectiveness. We also show that sequential compression--applying rounds of compression/decompression--significantly enhances defense efficacy while maintaining classification performance. Our findings reveal that human-aligned compression provides an effective, computationally efficient defense that protects the image features most relevant to human and machine understanding. It offers a practical approach to improving model robustness against adversarial threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Workshop AdvML at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy, highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose \textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks.

In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2025 (Selected for oral presentation) 2025/4/15 (v2): Corrected a notation error in Figure 2</p></details> | None |

ConvShareViT replaces linear layers in multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with a depthwise convolutional layer with shared weights across input channels. Through the development of ConvShareViT, the behaviour of convolutions within MHSA and their effectiveness in learning the attention mechanism were analysed systematically. Experimental results demonstrate that certain configurations, particularly those using valid-padded shared convolutions, can successfully learn attention, achieving comparable attention scores to those obtained with standard ViTs. However, other configurations, such as those using same-padded convolutions, show limitations in attention learning and operate like regular CNNs rather than transformer models. ConvShareViT architectures are specifically optimised for the 4f optical system, which takes advantage of the parallelism and high-resolution capabilities of optical systems. Results demonstrate that ConvShareViT can theoretically achieve up to 3.04 times faster inference than GPU-based systems. This potential acceleration makes ConvShareViT an attractive candidate for future optical deep learning applications and proves that our ViT (ConvShareViT) can be employed using only the convolution operation, via the necessary optimisation of the ViT to balance performance and complexity.</p></details> |  | None |

Given this importance, mapping wheat fields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy makers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions regarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of satellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat segmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of wheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing pipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed pipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as the clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By merging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method produces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to perform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level precision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational agricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate mapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical studies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision Mamba, an architecture based on State Space Models has emerged as an alternative addressing the aforementioned deficiencies and has been already applied to remote sensing change detection, though mostly as a feature extracting backbone. In this article the Change State Space Model is introduced, that has been specifically designed for change detection by focusing on the relevant changes between bi-temporal images, effectively filtering out irrelevant information. By concentrating solely on the changed features, the number of network parameters is reduced, enhancing significantly computational efficiency while maintaining high detection performance and robustness against input degradation. The proposed model has been evaluated via three benchmark datasets, where it outperformed ConvNets, ViTs, and Mamba-based counterparts at a fraction of their computational complexity.

However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and efficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a lightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment feasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable for multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and understanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the semantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive experiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance enhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget ($\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their impressive performance, ViTs exhibit notable vulnerability to evasion attacks, necessitating the development of specialized Adversarial Training (AT) strategies tailored to their unique architecture. While a direct solution might involve applying existing AT methods to ViTs, our analysis reveals significant incompatibilities, particularly with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches such as Generalist (CVPR 2023) and DBAT (USENIX Security 2024). This paper presents a systematic investigation of adversarial robustness in ViTs and provides a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained via derived MI bounds. Building on this insight, we propose a self-supervised AT method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate adversarial pre-training by masked image modeling with autoencoders. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that MIMIR can consistently provide improved natural and robust accuracy, where MIMIR outperforms SOTA AT results on ImageNet-1K. Notably, MIMIR demonstrates superior robustness against unforeseen attacks and common corruption data and can also withstand adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses full knowledge of the defense mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised framework for enhancing Fine-grained Representation in radiographic image analysis (AFiRe). The core idea of AFiRe is to align the anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifically, AFiRe synergistically performs two self-supervised schemes: (i) Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learning, which aligns image tokens based on structural and categorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained spatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removal restoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies, thereby refining the learned discrimination with detailed geometrical information. Additionally, we propose Synthetic Lesion Mask to enhance anatomical diversity while preserving intra-consistency, which is typically corrupted by traditional data augmentations, such as Cropping and Affine transformations. Experimental results show that AFiRe: (i) provides robust anatomical discrimination, achieving more cohesive feature clusters compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods; (ii) demonstrates superior generalization, surpassing 7 radiography-specific self-supervised methods in multi-label classification tasks with limited labeling; and (iii) integrates fine-grained information, enabling precise anomaly detection using only image-level annotations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LPViT: Low-Power Semi-structured Pruning for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02068v5)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve 3.93x speedup on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and a power reduction by 1.4x on GPUs.

| **[Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10916v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone. Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification. Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models. Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models. Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, they often suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using convolution neural networks or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of state space models (SSMs) in DG PCC and find that directly applying SSMs into DG PCC will encounter several challenges: the inherent topology of the point cloud tends to be disrupted and leads to noise accumulation during the serialization stage. Besides, the lack of designs in domain-agnostic feature learning and data scanning will introduce unanticipated domain-specific information into the 3D sequence data. To this end, we propose a novel framework, PointDGMamba, that excels in strong generalizability toward unseen domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. PointDGMamba consists of three innovative components: Masked Sequence Denoising (MSD), Sequence-wise Cross-domain Feature Aggregation (SCFA), and Dual-level Domain Scanning (DDS). In particular, MSD selectively masks out the noised point tokens of the point cloud sequences, SCFA introduces cross-domain but same-class point cloud features to encourage the model to learn how to extract more generalized features. DDS includes intra-domain scanning and cross-domain scanning to facilitate information exchange between features. In addition, we propose a new and more challenging benchmark PointDG-3to1 for multi-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of PointDGMamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025;</p></details> | None |

However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR semantic tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

However, their unique architectural properties raise new challenges and opportunities in adversarial robustness. In particular, we observe that adversarial examples crafted on ViTs exhibit higher transferability compared to those crafted on CNNs, suggesting that ViTs contain structural characteristics favorable for transferable attacks. In this work, we investigate the role of computational redundancy in ViTs and its impact on adversarial transferability. Unlike prior studies that aim to reduce computation for efficiency, we propose to exploit this redundancy to improve the quality and transferability of adversarial examples. Through a detailed analysis, we identify two forms of redundancy, including the data-level and model-level, that can be harnessed to amplify attack effectiveness. Building on this insight, we design a suite of techniques, including attention sparsity manipulation, attention head permutation, clean token regularization, ghost MoE diversification, and test-time adversarial training. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that our methods significantly outperform existing baselines in both transferability and generality across diverse model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. 10 pages. 4 figures</p></details> | None |

Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate vision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of introducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the distinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically compare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs. By scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance comparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components enhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal information flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision tasks such as semantic segmentation.

An efficient classification model can help wound specialists classify wound types with less financial and time costs and also help in deciding on the optimal treatment method. Traditional machine learning models suffer from feature selection and are usually cumbersome models for accurate recognition. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in wound diagnosis. Although DL seems promising for wound type recognition, there is still a large scope for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the model. In this study, a DL-based multimodal classifier was developed using wound images and their corresponding locations to classify them into multiple classes, including diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous ulcers. A body map was also created to provide location data, which can help wound specialists label wound locations more effectively. The model uses a Vision Transformer to extract hierarchical features from input images, a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to capture low and high frequency components, and a Transformer to extract spatial features. The number of neurons and weight vector optimization were performed using three swarm-based optimization techniques (Monster Gorilla Toner (MGTO), Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO), and Fox Optimization Algorithm). The evaluation results show that weight vector optimization using optimization algorithms can increase diagnostic accuracy and make it a very effective approach for wound detection. In the classification using the original body map, the proposed model was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.8123 using image data and an accuracy of 0.8007 using a combination of image data and wound location. Also, the accuracy of the model in combination with the optimization models varied from 0.7801 to 0.8342.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Controlled Dynamic Expansion Model for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10561v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) epitomizes an advanced training paradigm wherein prior data samples remain inaccessible during the acquisition of new tasks. Numerous investigations have delved into leveraging a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance model efficacy in continual learning. Nonetheless, these approaches typically utilize a singular, static backbone, which inadequately adapts to novel tasks, particularly when engaging with diverse data domains, due to a substantial number of inactive parameters. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing an innovative Self-Controlled Dynamic Expansion Model (SCDEM), which orchestrates multiple distinct trainable pre-trained ViT backbones to furnish diverse and semantically enriched representations. Specifically, by employing the multi-backbone architecture as a shared module, the proposed SCDEM dynamically generates a new expert with minimal parameters to accommodate a new task. A novel Collaborative Optimization Mechanism (COM) is introduced to synergistically optimize multiple backbones by harnessing prediction signals from historical experts, thereby facilitating new task learning without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Additionally, a novel Feature Distribution Consistency (FDC) approach is proposed to align semantic similarity between previously and currently learned representations through an optimal transport distance-based mechanism, effectively mitigating negative knowledge transfer effects. Furthermore, to alleviate over-regularization challenges, this paper presents a novel Dynamic Layer-Wise Feature Attention Mechanism (DLWFAM) to autonomously determine the penalization intensity on each trainable representation layer. An extensive series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed methodology's efficacy, with empirical results corroborating that the approach attains state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, Continual Learning, Cross-Domain Continual Learning, Mixture Model</p></details> | None |

However, existing model zoos are limited in size and architecture and neglect the transformer, which is among the currently most successful neural network architectures. We address this gap by introducing the first model zoo of vision transformers (ViT). To better represent recent training approaches, we develop a new blueprint for model zoo generation that encompasses both pre-training and fine-tuning steps, and publish 250 unique models. They are carefully generated with a large span of generating factors, and their diversity is validated using a thorough choice of weight-space and behavioral metrics. To further motivate the utility of our proposed dataset, we suggest multiple possible applications grounded in both extensive exploratory experiments and a number of examples from the existing literature. By extending previous lines of similar work, our model zoo allows researchers to push their model population-based methods from the small model regime to state-of-the-art architectures.

In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral geometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in vision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional structure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal components and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety of input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization in multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and specialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This specialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training data, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for boosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we translate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a technique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for gold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e., attributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual perspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performance on different data distributions while modelling an extremely interpretable and parameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on 70 pre-trained network-dataset combinations (7 models, 10 datasets).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages | None |
| **[Masked Autoencoder Self Pre-Training for Defect Detection in Microelectronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10021v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whereas in general computer vision, transformer-based architectures have quickly become the gold standard, microelectronics defect detection still heavily relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) labelled image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and labelled data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. Therefore, we evaluate self pre-training, where models are pre-trained on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). In MAE, a large share of image patches is masked and reconstructed by the model during pre-training. We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10.000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images labelled using transient thermal analysis (TTA). Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in the literature. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models, in comparison to ViT baselines, correctly focus on defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material. This demonstrates that our approach yields fault-specific feature representations, making our self pre-trained models viable for real-world defect detection in microelectronics.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Correlative and Discriminative Label Grouping for Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09990v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling label correlations has always played a pivotal role in multi-label image classification (MLC), attracting significant attention from researchers. However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> | None |

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the backbone of HSI classification, their limitations in capturing global contextual features have led to the exploration of Vision Transformers (ViTs). This paper introduces AMBER, an advanced SegFormer specifically designed for multi-band image segmentation. AMBER enhances the original SegFormer by incorporating three-dimensional convolutions, custom kernel sizes, and a Funnelizer layer. This architecture enables processing hyperspectral data directly, without requiring spectral dimensionality reduction during preprocessing. Our experiments, conducted on three benchmark datasets (Salinas, Indian Pines, and Pavia University) and on a dataset from the PRISMA satellite, show that AMBER outperforms traditional CNN-based methods in terms of Overall Accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and Average Accuracy on the first three datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PRISMA dataset. These findings highlight AMBER's robustness, adaptability to both airborne and spaceborne data, and its potential as a powerful solution for remote sensing and other domains requiring advanced analysis of high-dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Neural Computing & Applications (Springer).

Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we observe that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From this observation, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that enhances inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention outputs from each spatial query patch. Then, we align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher by applying head-wise structural attention distillation. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ViT-DFQ.

The DeepFool algorithm by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016) represents a pivotal step in identifying minimal perturbations required to induce misclassification of input images. Nonetheless, its generic methodology falls short in scenarios necessitating targeted interventions. Additionally, previous research studies have predominantly concentrated on the success rate of attacks without adequately addressing the consequential distortion of images, the maintenance of image quality, or the confidence threshold required for misclassification. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the Enhanced Targeted DeepFool (ET DeepFool) algorithm, an evolution of DeepFool that not only facilitates the specification of desired misclassification targets but also incorporates a configurable minimum confidence score. Our empirical investigations demonstrate the superiority of this refined approach in maintaining the integrity of images and minimizing perturbations across a variety of DNN architectures. Unlike previous iterations, such as the Targeted DeepFool by Gajjar et al. (2022), our method grants unparalleled control over the perturbation process, enabling precise manipulation of model responses. Preliminary outcomes reveal that certain models, including AlexNet and the advanced Vision Transformer, display commendable robustness to such manipulations. This discovery of varying levels of model robustness, as unveiled through our confidence level adjustments, could have far-reaching implications for the field of image recognition.

By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively. All three models surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MCUNet-in3/in4 (69.62% / 72.86%) and XiNet (72.27%), while maintaining a low computational cost of less than 100 million MACs and adhering to the stringent 320 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) constraint. These results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed framework for TinyML platforms, underscoring the potential of combining LLM-driven search, Pareto optimization, KD, and explainability to develop accurate, efficient, and interpretable models. This approach opens new possibilities in NAS, enabling the design of efficient architectures specifically suited for TinyML.</p></details> |  | None |

Using synthetic datasets with controlled variations in noise levels, angles, lengths, widths, and colors, we analyzed the behavior of ViTs fine-tuned with LoRA. Our findings revealed four key insights: First, ViTs exhibited an oblique effect showing the lowest angle prediction errors at 180 deg (horizontal) across all conditions. Second, angle prediction errors varied by color. Errors were highest for bluish hues and lowest for yellowish ones. Additionally, clustering analysis of angle prediction errors showed that ViTs grouped colors in a way that aligned with human perceptual categories. In addition to orientation and color biases, we observed phase transition phenomena. While two phase transitions occurred consistently across all conditions, the training loss curves exhibited delayed transitions when color was incorporated as an additional data attribute. Finally, we observed that attention heads in certain layers inherently develop specialized capabilities, functioning as task-agnostic feature extractors regardless of the downstream task. These observations suggest that biases and properties arise primarily from pre-training on the original dataset which shapes the model's foundational representations and the inherent architectural constraints of the vision transformer, rather than being solely determined by downstream data statistics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Occlusion-Robust Vision Transformers for Real-Time UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09228v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stream architectures using Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones show great potential for real-time UAV tracking recently. However, frequent occlusions from obstacles like buildings and trees expose a major drawback: these models often lack strategies to handle occlusions effectively. New methods are needed to enhance the occlusion resilience of single-stream ViT models in aerial tracking. In this work, we propose to learn Occlusion-Robust Representations (ORR) based on ViTs for UAV tracking by enforcing an invariance of the feature representation of a target with respect to random masking operations modeled by a spatial Cox process. Hopefully, this random masking approximately simulates target occlusions, thereby enabling us to learn ViTs that are robust to target occlusion for UAV tracking. This framework is termed ORTrack. Additionally, to facilitate real-time applications, we propose an Adaptive Feature-Based Knowledge Distillation (AFKD) method to create a more compact tracker, which adaptively mimics the behavior of the teacher model ORTrack according to the task's difficulty. This student model, dubbed ORTrack-D, retains much of ORTrack's performance while offering higher efficiency.

Although Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods often outperform Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods in FGBR, recent studies reveal that the limited receptive field of plain ViT model hinders representational richness and makes them vulnerable to scale variance. Thus, enhancing the multi-scale capabilities of existing ViT-based models to overcome this bottleneck in FGBR is a worthwhile pursuit. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for FGBR, namely Multi-scale Diverse Cues Modeling (MDCM), which explores diverse cues at different scales across various stages of a multi-scale Vision Transformer (MS-ViT) in an "Activation-Selection-Aggregation" paradigm. Specifically, we first propose a multi-scale cue activation module to ensure the discriminative cues learned at different stage are mutually different. Subsequently, a multi-scale token selection mechanism is proposed to remove redundant noise and highlight discriminative, scale-specific cues at each stage. Finally, the selected tokens from each stage are independently utilized for bird recognition, and the recognition results from multiple stages are adaptively fused through a multi-scale dynamic aggregation mechanism for final model decisions. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDCM, which outperforms CNN- and ViT-based models on several widely-used FGBR benchmarks.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |

However, efficiently combining these two paradigms to better capture long-range dependencies in complex images remains a challenge. In this paper, we present iiANET (Inception Inspired Attention Network), an efficient hybrid visual backbone designed to improve the modeling of long-range dependen-cies. The core innovation of iiANET is the iiABlock, a unified building block that in-tegrates global r-MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention) and convolutional layers in paral-lel. This design enables iiABlock to simultaneously capture global context and local details, making it highly effective for extracting rich and diverse features. By effi-ciently fusing these complementary representations, iiABlock allows iiANET to achieve strong feature interaction while maintaining computational efficiency. Exten-sive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various benchmarks show im-proved performance over several state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior research has underscored the distinct advantages of each architecture, and there is growing evidence that combining modules from different architectures can boost performance. In this study, we build upon and improve previous work exploring the complementarity between different architectures. Instead of heuristically merging modules from various architectures through trial and error, we preserve the integrity of each architecture and combine them using ensemble techniques. By maintaining the distinctiveness of each architecture, we aim to explore their inherent complementarity more deeply and with implicit isolation. This approach provides a more systematic understanding of their individual strengths. In addition to uncovering insights into architectural complementarity, we showcase the effectiveness of even basic ensemble methods that combine models from diverse architectures. These methods outperform ensembles comprised of similar architectures. Our straightforward ensemble framework serves as a foundational strategy for blending complementary architectures, offering a solid starting point for further investigations into the unique strengths and synergies among different architectures and their ensembles in image classification. A direct outcome of this work is the creation of an ensemble of classification networks that surpasses the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art single classification network on ImageNet, setting a new benchmark, all while requiring less overall latency.</p></details> |  | None |

While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages + references, 5 figures, 2 tables in IEEE double column conference template</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Additive Parameter Updates of Vision Transformers for Few-Shot Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08982v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating new class information without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) addresses this by first training a model on a robust dataset of base classes and then incrementally adapting it in successive sessions using only a few labeled examples per novel class. However, this approach is prone to overfitting on the limited new data, which can compromise overall performance and exacerbate forgetting. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective novel FSCIL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone augmented with parameter-efficient additive updates. Our approach freezes the pre-trained ViT parameters and selectively injects trainable weights into the self-attention modules via an additive update mechanism. This design updates only a small subset of parameters to accommodate new classes without sacrificing the representations learned during the base session. By fine-tuning a limited number of parameters, our method preserves the generalizable features in the frozen ViT while reducing the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, as most parameters remain fixed, the model avoids overwriting previously learned knowledge when small novel data batches are introduced. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline FSCIL methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |

We address this gap by training SAEs on CLIP's vision transformer and uncover key differences between vision and language processing, including distinct sparsity patterns for SAEs trained across layers and token types. We then provide the first systematic analysis on the steerability of CLIP's vision transformer by introducing metrics to quantify how precisely SAE features can be steered to affect the model's output. We find that 10-15\% of neurons and features are steerable, with SAEs providing thousands more steerable features than the base model. Through targeted suppression of SAE features, we then demonstrate improved performance on three vision disentanglement tasks (CelebA, Waterbirds, and typographic attacks), finding optimal disentanglement in middle model layers, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on defense against typographic attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an alternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the computational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To address these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT), which incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the vision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HgVT leverages population and diversity regularization for dynamic hypergraph construction without clustering, and expert edge pooling to enhance semantic extraction and facilitate graph-based image retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that HgVT achieves strong performance on image classification and retrieval, positioning it as an efficient framework for semantic-based vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

As such, development of automated systems capable of detecting such events is of considerable importance in both academic and industrial contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning for detecting thermal runaway in the battery production line of VDL Nedcar, a Dutch automobile manufacturer. Specifically, we collect data from the production line to represent both baseline (non thermal runaway) and thermal runaway conditions. Thermal runaway was simulated through the use of external heat and smoke sources. The data consisted of both optical and thermal images which were then preprocessed and fused before serving as input to our models. In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs. The obtained results indicate that the use of deep learning is a viable approach to thermal runaway detection in battery production lines.</p></details> |  | None |

For this reason, deep learning researchers are proposing more approaches to develop lower compute models. However, since vision transformers are very new to the edge use case, there are still unexplored approaches, most notably conditional execution of subnetworks based on input data. In this work, we explore the training of a single species detector which uses conditional computation to bias structured sub networks in a geographically-aware manner. We propose a method for pruning the expert model per location and demonstrate conditional computation performance on two geographically distributed datasets: iNaturalist and iWildcam.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates adapters within the self-attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers to enhance knowledge retention when sequentially adding datasets from different domains. Unlike previous methods that continue learning with only one dataset, our approach introduces domain-specific output heads and feature gating, allowing the model to maintain high accuracy on previously learned tasks while incorporating only the essential information from multiple domains. The proposed method is compared to prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in the current state of the art. The results provide evidence that our method effectively alleviates the limitations of previous works. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis using three datasets, CIFAR-100, Flowers102, and DTD, each representing a distinct domain, to investigate the impact of task order on model performance. Our findings underscore the critical role of dataset sequencing in shaping learning outcomes, demonstrating that strategic ordering can significantly improve the model's ability to adapt to evolving data distributions over time while preserving the integrity of previously learned knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Applied Intelligence (Springer), under review since November 26, 2024</p></details> | None |

Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Hybrid Fully Convolutional CNN-Transformer Model for Inherently Interpretable Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08481v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid CNN-ViT models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for medical image classification. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the model's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical image classification tasks using color fundus images. Our model not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to both black-box and interpretable models but also provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

We further explore self-supervised pre-training, conduct experiments with limited labeled data, and benchmark our contribution and adaptations thoroughly in ablation experiments against a baseline, where the model is tested on tasks such as height reconstruction and segmentation. Our approach achieves up to 17% improvement in terms of RMSE over baseline models</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Breaking the Barriers: Video Vision Transformers for Word-Level Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07792v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language is a fundamental means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) community, enabling nuanced expression through gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Despite its critical role in facilitating interaction within the DHH population, significant barriers persist due to the limited fluency in sign language among the hearing population. Overcoming this communication gap through automatic sign language recognition (SLR) remains a challenge, particularly at a dynamic word-level, where temporal and spatial dependencies must be effectively recognized. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown potential in SLR, they are computationally intensive and have difficulties in capturing global temporal dependencies between video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model for word-level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks. The VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset, highlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%. Our study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great potential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the inclusion of DHH individuals.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Object Focused Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08166v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptation to the training of Vision Transformers (ViTs) that allows for an explicit modeling of objects during the attention computation. This is achieved by adding a new branch to selected attention layers that computes an auxiliary loss which we call the object-focused attention (OFA) loss. We restrict the attention to image patches that belong to the same object class, which allows ViTs to gain a better understanding of configural (or holistic) object shapes by focusing on intra-object patches instead of other patches such as those in the background. Our proposed inductive bias fits easily into the attention framework of transformers since it only adds an auxiliary loss over selected attention layers. Furthermore, our approach has no additional overhead during inference. We also experiment with multiscale masking to further improve the performance of our OFA model and give a path forward for self-supervised learning with our method. Our experimental results demonstrate that ViTs with OFA achieve better classification results than their base models, exhibit a stronger generalization ability to out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarially corrupted images, and learn representations based on object shapes rather than spurious correlations via general textures. For our OOD setting, we generate a novel dataset using the COCO dataset and Stable Diffusion inpainting which we plan to share with the community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring a Patch-Wise Approach for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07761v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an increasingly digitalized world, verifying the authenticity of ID documents has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most studies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to privacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that makes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy (i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed approach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. Also, state-of-the-art methods such as Vision Transformers and Foundation Models are considered in the analysis. The experimental framework shows that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at patch and ID document level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to this exploration, another key contribution of our study is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from both real and fake ID documents, along with the experimental framework and models, which will be available in our GitHub.</p></details> |  | None |

Teleconnections, such as the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), offer windows of enhanced predictability, however, their complex interactions remain underutilized in operational forecasting. Here, we developed and evaluated deep learning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather regimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S forecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on previous regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3) a ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and tropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with operational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that leveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times. Notably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4 by improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions. Analysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR opportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase patterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns. Overall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate fields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal forecast. Moreover, the experiments highlight the potential of deep learning methods as investigative tools, providing new insights into atmospheric dynamics and predictability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures | None |

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million deaths happen each year due to precisely heart diseases. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid and effective prediction. In this work, an automatic system which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences is proposed for the challenging and more specific task of prediction of heart failure times. This system is based on a novel deep learning framework, and works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography video sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training phase of any kind of machine learning-based framework, including a deep learning one. This initial stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which have been so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are applied to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases of echocardiograms. The designed neural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with respect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.19579</p></details> | None |

Automatic Pneumonia detection from CXR images by deep learning model has emerged as a prominent and dynamic area of research, since the inception of the new Covid-19 variant in 2020. However, the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models encounter challenges associated with class imbalance, a prevalent issue found in many medical datasets. The innovations introduced in the proposed model architecture include: (I) A very lightweight CNN model, `VGG-Lite', is proposed as a base model, inspired by VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2 architecture. (II) On top of this base model, we leverage an ``Edge Enhanced Module (EEM)" through a parallel branch, consisting of a ``negative image layer", and a novel custom pooling layer ``2Max-Min Pooling". This 2Max-Min Pooling layer is entirely novel in this investigation, providing more attention to edge components within pneumonia CXR images. Thus, it works as an efficient spatial attention module (SAM). We have implemented the proposed framework on two separate CXR datasets. The first dataset is obtained from a readily available source on the internet, and the second dataset is a more challenging CXR dataset, assembled by our research team from three different sources. Experimental results reveal that our proposed framework has outperformed pre-trained CNN models, and three recent trend existing models ``Vision Transformer", ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'' and ``PneuNet", by substantial margins on both datasets. The proposed framework VGG-Lite with EEM, has achieved a macro average of 95% accuracy, 97.1% precision, 96.1% recall, and 96.6% F1 score on the ``Pneumonia Imbalance CXR dataset", without employing any pre-processing technique.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) sub-blocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. This statistical mechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal macroscopic behavior of the entire network from the microscopic performance of each node. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, A short YouTube Video describing the main results https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I8bp7UAudk</p></details> | None |

Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of attention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to effectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a layer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes self-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention to focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework, where the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT allows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features, progressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally interpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the refined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves consistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models. These results highlight the effectiveness of EDIT's design in addressing attention sink and improving visual feature extraction.</p></details> |  | None |

While Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models improve SISR by capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from quadratic computational costs or employ selective attention mechanisms that do not explicitly focus on query-relevant regions. Despite these advancements, prior work has overlooked how selective attention mechanisms should be effectively designed for SISR. We propose SSCAN, which dynamically selects the most relevant key-value windows based on query similarity, ensuring focused feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. In contrast to prior approaches that apply attention globally or heuristically, our method introduces a query-aware window selection strategy that better aligns attention computation with important image regions. By incorporating fixed-sized windows, SSCAN reduces memory usage and enforces linear token-to-token complexity, making it scalable for large images. Our experiments demonstrate that SSCAN outperforms existing attention-based SISR methods, achieving up to 0.14 dB PSNR improvement on urban datasets, guaranteeing both computational efficiency and reconstruction quality in SISR.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Discovering Influential Neuron Path in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09046v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer models exhibit immense power yet remain opaque to human understanding, posing challenges and risks for practical applications. While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning.

| **[HGFormer: Topology-Aware Vision Transformer with HyperGraph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02440v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computer vision community has witnessed an extensive exploration of vision transformers in the past two years. Drawing inspiration from traditional schemes, numerous works focus on introducing vision-specific inductive biases. However, the implicit modeling of permutation invariance and fully-connected interaction with individual tokens disrupts the regional context and spatial topology, further hindering higher-order modeling. This deviates from the principle of perceptual organization that emphasizes the local groups and overall topology of visual elements. Thus, we introduce the concept of hypergraph for perceptual exploration. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware vision transformer called HyperGraph Transformer (HGFormer). Firstly, we present a Center Sampling K-Nearest Neighbors (CS-KNN) algorithm for semantic guidance during hypergraph construction. Secondly, we present a topology-aware HyperGraph Attention (HGA) mechanism that integrates hypergraph topology as perceptual indications to guide the aggregation of global and unbiased information during hypergraph messaging. Using HGFormer as visual backbone, we develop an effective and unitive representation, achieving distinct and detailed scene depictions. Empirical experiments show that the proposed HGFormer achieves competitive performance compared to the recent SoTA counterparts on various visual benchmarks. Extensive ablation and visualization studies provide comprehensive explanations of our ideas and contributions.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing transformer-based encoder-decoder frameworks have demonstrated remarkable versatility and zero-shot performance in medical segmentation. While beneficial, they usually require huge memory costs when handling large-size segmentation mask predictions, which are expensive to apply to real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient framework for high-resolution medical image segmentation, called HRMedSeg. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight gated vision transformer (LGViT) as our image encoder to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. Then, we design an efficient cross-multiscale decoder (ECM-Decoder) to generate high-resolution segmentation masks. Moreover, we utilize feature distillation during pretraining to unleash the potential of our proposed model. Extensive experiments reveal that HRMedSeg outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse high-resolution medical image segmentation tasks. In particular, HRMedSeg uses only 0.59GB GPU memory per batch during fine-tuning, demonstrating low training costs. Besides, when HRMedSeg meets the Segment Anything Model (SAM), our HRMedSegSAM takes 0.61% parameters of SAM-H. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/HRMedSeg.</p></details> | Under Review | [Code Link](https://github.com/xq141839/HRMedSeg) |

A kernel theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16391v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations support this ability; however, the conditions under which they are sufficient for the emergence of compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, compositionally structured representations. This provides a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of training data statistics on generalization. We find that these models are limited to functions that assign values to each combination of components seen during training, and then sum up these values ("conjunction-wise additivity"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks compositionally structured kernel models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that they can learn in principle, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization (memorization leak and shortcut bias) that arise from biases in the training data. Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work examines how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data, trained models still retain the influence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed often rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as storing client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available dataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method that leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF). Our approach only uses standard client model updates, anyway employed during regular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs to be forgotten, we apply the negated of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately scaled, to the global model. Unlike state-of-the-art mechanisms, PUF seamlessly integrates with FL workflows, incurs no additional computational and communication overhead beyond standard FL rounds, and supports concurrent unlearning requests. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on two well-known benchmark image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and a real-world medical imaging dataset for segmentation (ProstateMRI), using three different neural architectures: two residual networks and a vision transformer. The experimental results across various settings demonstrate that PUF achieves state-of-the-art forgetting effectiveness and recovery time, without relying on any additional assumptions, thus underscoring its practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transferable Mask Transformer: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vision Transformers with Autoencoders and Explainable AI for Cancer Patient Risk Stratification Using Whole Slide Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04749v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption. In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context. PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |
| **[Mixed-Precision Quantization for Deep Vision Models with Integer Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05657v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a widely used technique to compress neural networks. Assigning uniform bit-widths across all layers can result in significant accuracy degradation at low precision and inefficiency at high precision. Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) addresses this by assigning varied bit-widths to layers, optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Existing sensitivity-based methods for MPQ assume that quantization errors across layers are independent, which leads to suboptimal choices. We introduce CLADO, a practical sensitivity-based MPQ algorithm that captures cross-layer dependency of quantization error. CLADO approximates pairwise cross-layer errors using linear equations on a small data subset. Layerwise bit-widths are assigned by optimizing a new MPQ formulation based on cross-layer quantization errors using an Integer Quadratic Program. Experiments with CNN and vision transformer models on ImageNet demonstrate that CLADO achieves state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization performance.

However, existing approaches primarily emphasize the representation of such features while neglecting their precise localization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases. This limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on transfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of leveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained attributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and high-variance classification scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Gaze-CIFAR-10, a human gaze time-series dataset, along with a dual-sequence gaze encoder that models the precise sequential localization of human attention on distinct local attributes. In parallel, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to learn the sequential representation of image content. Through cross-modal fusion, our framework integrates human gaze priors with machine-derived visual sequences, effectively correcting inaccurate localization in image feature representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that gaze-guided cognitive cues significantly enhance classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, URL: https://szyyjl.github.io/eye_tracking_data.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://szyyjl.github.io/eye_tracking_data.github.io) |

Pre-trained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in extracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like Grad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse heatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach, Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images (i.e., traits). As a result, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a ``free lunch,'' requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.

As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Resilience of Vision Transformers for Domain Generalisation in the Presence of Out-of-Distribution Noisy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04225v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI models excel in controlled settings but often fail in real-world scenarios where data distributions shift unpredictably - a challenge known as domain generalisation (DG). This paper tackles this limitation by rigorously evaluating vision tramsformers, specifically the BEIT architecture which is a model pre-trained with masked image modelling (MIM), against synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks designed to mimic real-world noise and occlusions. We introduce a novel framework to generate OOD test cases by strategically masking object regions in images using grid patterns (25\%, 50\%, 75\% occlusion) and leveraging cutting-edge zero-shot segmentation via Segment Anything and Grounding DINO to ensure precise object localisation. Experiments across three benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet) demonstrate BEIT's known robustness while maintaining 94\% accuracy on PACS and 87\% on Office-Home, despite significant occlusions, outperforming CNNs and other vision transformers by margins of up to 37\%. Analysis of self-attention distances reveals that the BEIT dependence on global features correlates with its resilience. Furthermore, our synthetic benchmarks expose critical failure modes: performance degrades sharply when occlusions disrupt object shapes e.g. 68\% drop for external grid masking vs. 22\% for internal masking. This work provides two key advances (1) a scalable method to generate OOD benchmarks using controllable noise, and (2) empirical evidence that MIM and self-attention mechanism in vision transformers enhance DG by learning invariant features. These insights bridge the gap between lab-trained models and real-world deployment that offer a blueprint for building AI systems that generalise reliably under uncertainty.</p></details> | 31 pages | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

This paper introduces a novel grouped structural pruning method for pre-trained vision transformers (ViT, BeiT, and DeiT), evaluated on the PACS and Office-Home DG benchmarks. Our method uses dependency graph analysis to identify and remove redundant groups of neurons, weights, filters, or attention heads within transformers, using a range of selection metrics. Grouped structural pruning is applied at pruning ratios of 50\%, 75\% and 95\% and the models are then fine-tuned on selected distributions from DG benchmarks to evaluate their overall performance in DG tasks. Results show significant improvements in inference speed and fine-tuning time with minimal trade-offs in accuracy and DG task performance. For instance, on the PACS benchmark, pruning ViT, BeiT, and DeiT models by 50\% using the Hessian metric resulted in accuracy drops of only -2.94\%, -1.42\%, and -1.72\%, respectively, while achieving speed boosts of 2.5x, 1.81x, and 2.15x. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing model efficiency with domain generalisation performance.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

In the histological domain, tissue images are expensive to obtain and constitute sensitive medical information, raising concerns about data scarcity and privacy. Vision Transformers are state-of-the-art computer vision models that have proven helpful in many tasks, including image classification. In this work, we combine vision Transformers with generative adversarial networks to generate histopathological images related to colorectal cancer and test their quality by augmenting a training dataset, leading to improved classification accuracy. Then, we replicate this performance using the federated learning technique and a realistic Kubernetes setup with multiple nodes, simulating a scenario where the training dataset is split among several hospitals unable to share their information directly due to privacy concerns.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to relatively lagging performance of event-based approaches, event cameras have not yet replace traditional cameras in performance-critical applications like autonomous driving. Recent approaches in event-based object detection try to bridge this gap by employing computationally expensive transformer-based solutions. However, due to their resource-intensive components, these solutions fail to exploit the sparsity and higher temporal resolution of event cameras efficiently. Moreover, these solutions are adopted from the vision domain, lacking specificity to the event cameras. In this work, we explore efficient and performant alternatives to recurrent vision transformer models and propose a novel event-based object detection backbone. The proposed backbone employs a novel Event Progression Extractor module, tailored specifically for event data, and uses Metaformer concept with convolution-based efficient components. We evaluate the resultant model on well-established traffic object detection benchmarks and conduct cross-dataset evaluation to test its ability to generalize. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on Prophesee Gen1 dataset by 1.6 mAP while reducing inference time by 14%. Our proposed EMF becomes the fastest DNN-based architecture in the domain by outperforming most efficient event-based object detectors. Moreover, the proposed model shows better ability to generalize to unseen data and scales better with the abundance of data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |

Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

In real-world clinical scenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often acquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning models assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between pretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when there is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model, often resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer (AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for each case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image modalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the transformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture effectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with different input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on zero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks. Additionally, for self-supervised pretrain, the proposed method is able to maximize the pretrain data and facilitate transferring to diverse downstream tasks with variable sets of input modalities.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a persistent challenge, particularly in the presence of significant domain shifts across tasks. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. The orthogonal LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in an orthogonal subspace of previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while the residual LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in the residual subspace spanned by task-specific bases without interaction across tasks, offering complementary capabilities for fine-tuning new tasks. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and memory efficiency over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a major deduction error in Section 4.1 of the paper, and the relevant results in Table 1 and Table 2 need to be corrected</p></details> | None |

Unlike the previous GPTQ method, which independently calibrates each layer, we always match the quantized layer's output to the exact output in the full-precision model, resulting in a scheme that we call asymmetric calibration. Such a scheme can effectively reduce the quantization error accumulated in previous layers. We analyze this problem using optimal brain compression to derive a close-formed solution. The new solution explicitly minimizes the quantization error as well as the accumulated asymmetry error. Furthermore, we utilize various techniques to parallelize the solution calculation, including channel parallelization, neuron decomposition, and Cholesky reformulation for matrix fusion. As a result, GPTQv2 is easy to implement, simply using 20 more lines of code than GPTQ but improving its performance under low-bit quantization. Remarkably, on a single GPU, we quantize a 405B language transformer as well as EVA-02 the rank first vision transformer that achieves 90% pretraining Imagenet accuracy.

Metamers - stimuli that are physically distinct yet produce identical neural activations - serve as a valuable tool for investigating these invariances. We introduce a novel approach to metamer generation by leveraging ensembles of artificial neural networks, capturing shared representational subspaces across diverse architectures, including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. To characterize the properties of the generated metamers, we employ a suite of image-based metrics that assess factors such as semantic fidelity and naturalness. Our findings show that convolutional neural networks generate more recognizable and human-like metamers, while vision transformers produce realistic but less transferable metamers, highlighting the impact of architectural biases on representational invariances.</p></details> |  | None |
