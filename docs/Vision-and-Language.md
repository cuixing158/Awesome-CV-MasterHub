GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitting for Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |
| **[CacheFlow: Compressive Streaming Memory for Efficient Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13644v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video question answering (VQA) overwhelms current vision-language models (VLMs) because attention and key-value (KV) caches grow with runtime, forcing either expensive inference or near-sighted sliding windows. We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures,The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI 2026),Paper has been accepted for a poster presentation</p></details> | None |
| **[FreeAskWorld: An Interactive and Closed-Loop Simulator for Human-Centric Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13524v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Language-Guided Invariance Probing of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13494v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, OpenCLIP, EVA02-CLIP and SigLIP achieve strong zero-shot performance, but it is unclear how reliably they respond to controlled linguistic perturbations. We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic. Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Document Derendering: SVG Reconstruction via Vision-Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13478v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Trust in Vision-Language Models: Insights from a Participatory User Workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13458v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large image-text and video-text datasets, it is critical to equip users with the tools to discern when to trust these systems. However, examining how user trust in VLMs builds and evolves remains an open problem. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing reliance on AI models as judges for experimental validation, to bypass the cost and implications of running participatory design studies directly with users. Following a user-centred approach, this paper presents preliminary results from a workshop with prospective VLM users. Insights from this pilot workshop inform future studies aimed at contextualising trust metrics and strategies for participants' engagement to fit the case of user-VLM interaction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VOPE: Revisiting Hallucination of Vision-Language Models in Voluntary Imagination Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13420v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most research on hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) focuses on factual description tasks that prohibit any output absent from the image. However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13397v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Moving Pictures of Thought: Extracting Visual Knowledge in Charles S. Peirce's Manuscripts with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13378v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LLMC+: Benchmarking Vision-Language Model Compression with a Plug-and-play Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09981v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM.

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TabFlash: Efficient Table Understanding with Progressive Question Conditioning and Token Focusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13283v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table images present unique challenges for effective and efficient understanding due to the need for question-specific focus and the presence of redundant background regions. Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> | None |

This practical trade-off between transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all models should be \textit{identical} across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA), which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity. In this way, the number of within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models, SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency according to specific resource requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

A Comprehensive Spatial Intelligence Benchmark for UAV Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13269v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leveraging their powerful visual perception and reasoning capabilities, have been widely applied in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tasks. However, the spatial intelligence capabilities of existing VLMs in UAV scenarios remain largely unexplored, raising concerns about their effectiveness in navigating and interpreting dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpatialSky-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial intelligence capabilities of VLMs in UAV navigation. Our benchmark comprises two categories-Environmental Perception and Scene Understanding-divided into 13 subcategories, including bounding boxes, color, distance, height, and landing safety analysis, among others. Extensive evaluations of various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal unsatisfactory performance in complex UAV navigation scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in their spatial capabilities. To address this challenge, we developed the SpatialSky-Dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing 1M samples with diverse annotations across various scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce Sky-VLM, a specialized VLM designed for UAV spatial reasoning across multiple granularities and contexts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Sky-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmark tasks, paving the way for the development of VLMs suitable for UAV scenarios.

In this work, we start by identifying three core tasks: egocentric procedural error detection, egocentric procedural learning, and egocentric procedural question answering. These tasks define the essential functions of EgoProceAssist within a new taxonomy. Specifically, our work encompasses a comprehensive review of current techniques, relevant datasets, and evaluation metrics across these three core areas. To clarify the gap between the proposed EgoProceAssist and existing VLM-based AI assistants, we introduce novel experiments and provide a comprehensive evaluation of representative VLM-based methods. Based on these findings and our technical analysis, we discuss the challenges ahead and suggest future research directions.

The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune) |

In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, DeMo assumes that models fit on a single accelerator. We relax this assumption and introduce FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication is reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients -- resulting in a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy. We further introduce a framework, denoted as DeToNATION, that generalizes DeMo, FlexDeMo, and other popular distributed training schemes such as DiLoCo -- introducing new variations of replication schemes and challenging choices made in DeMo. Our results across language and vision domains show that FlexDeMo attains similar validation loss as hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization, while being substantially faster. FlexDeMo is thus a promising distributed training scheme for the largest machine learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> | None |

We propose Geometric Distillation, a lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3) dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R, VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout).</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2026 Under Review</p></details> | None |

Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results.

Recently, there has been interest in the specific task of \textit{Delta Compression}, where parties each hold a common base model and only communicate compressed weight updates. However, popular parameter efficient updates such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) face inherent representation limitations - which are especially pronounced when combined with aggressive quantization. To overcome this, we build on recent work that improves LoRA representation capacity by using fixed-frequency sinusoidal functions to increase stable rank without adding additional parameters. We extend this to the quantized setting and present the first theoretical analysis showing how stable rank evolves under quantization. From this, we introduce SineLoRA$Δ$, a principled and effective method for delta compression that improves the expressivity of quantized low-rank adapters by applying a sinusoidal activation. We validate SineLoRA$Δ$ across a diverse variety of domains - including language modeling, vision-language tasks, and text-to-image generation - achieving up to 66% memory reduction with similar performance. We additionally provide a novel application of the canonical Bjøntegaard Delta metric to consistently compare adapter compression changes across the rate-distortion curve.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |

To meet these requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs). However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this paradigm, we design edgeVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision-lanuage reasoning tasks across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page can be found at https://dinyudin203.github.io/uCLIP-project/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://dinyudin203.github.io/uCLIP-project) |

However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages, 21 figures | None |

However, its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present RadarLLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding from radar signals. RadarLLM introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture, integrating deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to convert spatial-temporal radar sequences into compact semantic tokens; and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To overcome the scarcity of paired radar-text data, we generate a realistic radar-text dataset from motion-text datasets with a physics-aware synthesis pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that RadarLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust and interpretable motion understanding under privacy and visibility constraints, even in adverse environments.

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures | None |

Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., "how to interact"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., "when to interact") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.</p></details> |  | None |

While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, accepted in the main technical track of AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Direct Visual Grounding by Directing Attention of Visual Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12738v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) mix visual tokens and text tokens. A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task.</p></details> |  | None |

As these models gain traction in high-stakes applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance, understanding their security risks becomes crucial. In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations. The code to reproduce LAYA is publicly available at: https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA) |

Most existing models rely on large-scale gaze datasets to learn these patterns; however, such datasets are labor-intensive to collect and time-consuming to curate. We present FSDAM (Few-Shot Driver Attention Modeling), a framework that achieves joint attention prediction and caption generation with approximately 100 annotated examples, two orders of magnitude fewer than existing approaches. Our approach introduces a dual-pathway architecture where separate modules handle spatial prediction and caption generation while maintaining semantic consistency through cross-modal alignment. Despite minimal supervision, FSDAM achieves competitive performance on attention prediction, generates coherent, and context-aware explanations. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across multiple driving benchmarks. This work shows that effective attention-conditioned generation is achievable with limited supervision, opening new possibilities for practical deployment of explainable driver attention systems in data-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaffolding Dexterous Manipulation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19212v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However, sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet") and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate multilingual generalization in encoder-decoder transformer VLMs to enable zero-shot image captioning in languages encountered only in the translation task. In this setting, the encoder must learn to generate generalizable, task-aware latent vision representations to instruct the decoder via inserted cross-attention layers. To analyze scaling behavior, we train Florence-2 based and Gemma-2 based models (0.4B to 11.2B parameters) on a synthetic dataset using varying compute budgets. While all languages in the dataset have image-aligned translations, only a subset of them include image captions. Notably, we show that captioning can emerge using a language prefix, even when this language only appears in the translation task. We find that indirect learning of unseen task-language pairs adheres to scaling laws that are governed by the multilinguality of the model, model size, and seen training samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the scaling laws extend to downstream tasks, achieving competitive performance through fine-tuning in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[X-VMamba: Explainable Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12694v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains.

We present HEDGE, a unified framework for hallucination detection that combines controlled visual perturbations, semantic clustering, and robust uncertainty metrics. HEDGE integrates sampling, distortion synthesis, clustering (entailment- and embedding-based), and metric computation into a reproducible pipeline applicable across multimodal architectures. Evaluations on VQA-RAD and KvasirVQA-x1 with three representative VLMs (LLaVA-Med, Med-Gemma, Qwen2.5-VL) reveal clear architecture- and prompt-dependent trends. Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses. By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE) |

We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery. We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images. Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Knowledge Intervention Prompt Tuning for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12639v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown great potential in feature transfer and generalization across a wide spectrum of medical-related downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness.

| **[Rank-Aware Agglomeration of Foundation Models for Immunohistochemistry Image Cell Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12588v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cell counting in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images is critical for quantifying protein expression and aiding cancer diagnosis. However, the task remains challenging due to the chromogen overlap, variable biomarker staining, and diverse cellular morphologies. Regression-based counting methods offer advantages over detection-based ones in handling overlapped cells, yet rarely support end-to-end multi-class counting. Moreover, the potential of foundation models remains largely underexplored in this paradigm. To address these limitations, we propose a rank-aware agglomeration framework that selectively distills knowledge from multiple strong foundation models, leveraging their complementary representations to handle IHC heterogeneity and obtain a compact yet effective student model, CountIHC. Unlike prior task-agnostic agglomeration strategies that either treat all teachers equally or rely on feature similarity, we design a Rank-Aware Teacher Selecting (RATS) strategy that models global-to-local patch rankings to assess each teacher's inherent counting capacity and enable sample-wise teacher selection. For multi-class cell counting, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that reformulates the task as vision-language alignment. Discrete semantic anchors derived from structured text prompts encode both category and quantity information, guiding the regression of class-specific density maps and improving counting for overlapping cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountIHC surpasses state-of-the-art methods across 12 IHC biomarkers and 5 tissue types, while exhibiting high agreement with pathologists' assessments. Its effectiveness on H&E-stained data further confirms the scalability of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this limitation, we propose MR-COSMO, a Visual-Text Memory Recall and Direct CrOSs-MOdal Alignment Method for Query-Driven 3D Segmentation, establishing explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and text/2D image data through a dedicated direct cross-modal alignment module while implementing a visual-text memory module with specialized feature banks. This direct alignment mechanism enables precise fusion of geometric and semantic features, while the memory module employs specialized banks storing text features, visual features, and their correspondence mappings to dynamically enhance scene-specific representations via attention-based knowledge recall. Comprehensive experiments across 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation benchmarks confirm state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

Video understanding often relies on effective keyframes that are not only informative but also causally decisive. To this end, we propose Reinforced Causal Search with Information Bottleneck (ReaSon), a framework that formulates keyframe selection as an optimization problem with the help of a novel Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), which explicitly defines keyframes as those satisfying both predictive sufficiency and causal necessity. Specifically, ReaSon employs a learnable policy network to select keyframes from a visually relevant pool of candidate frames to capture predictive sufficiency, and then assesses causal necessity via counterfactual interventions. Finally, a composite reward aligned with the CIB principle is designed to guide the selection policy through reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on NExT-QA, EgoSchema, and Video-MME demonstrate that ReaSon consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under limited-frame settings, validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, existing methods 1) fail to account for the degradation visible images under adverse weather conditions, thereby compromising fusion performance; and 2) rely on fixed network architectures, limiting their adaptability to diverse degradation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a one-stop degradation-aware image fusion framework for multi-degradation scenarios driven by a large language model (MdaIF). Given the distinct scattering characteristics of different degradation scenarios (e.g., haze, rain, and snow) in atmospheric transmission, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) system is introduced to tackle image fusion across multiple degradation scenarios. To adaptively extract diverse weather-aware degradation knowledge and scene feature representations, collectively referred to as the semantic prior, we employ a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) in our framework. Guided by the semantic prior, we propose degradation-aware channel attention module (DCAM), which employ degradation prototype decomposition to facilitate multi-modal feature interaction in channel domain. In addition, to achieve effective expert routing, the semantic prior and channel-domain modulated features are utilized to guide the MoE, enabling robust image fusion in complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our MdaIF, demonstrating superior performance over SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

| **[One VLM, Two Roles: Stage-Wise Routing and Specialty-Level Deployment for Clinical Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839v4)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical ML workflows are often fragmented and inefficient: triage, task selection, and model deployment are handled by a patchwork of task-specific networks. These pipelines are rarely aligned with data-science practice, reducing efficiency and increasing operational cost. They also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. We present a framework that employs a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary, modular roles. First (Solution 1): the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card ID). Reliability is improved by (i) stage-wise prompts enabling early termination via "None"/"Other" and (ii) a calibrated top-2 answer selector with a stage-wise cutoff. This raises routing accuracy by +9 and +11 percentage points on the training and held-out splits, respectively, compared with a baseline router, and improves held-out calibration (lower Expected Calibration Error, ECE). Second (Solution 2): we fine-tune the same VLM on specialty-specific datasets so that one model per specialty covers multiple downstream tasks, simplifying deployment while maintaining performance. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, pathology, and radiology, this single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines. Together, these solutions reduce data-science effort through more accurate selection, simplify monitoring and maintenance by consolidating task-specific models, and increase transparency via per-stage justifications and calibrated thresholds. Each solution stands alone, and in combination they offer a practical, modular path from triage to deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

We think that mixing both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion understanding, and behavior interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of the manuscript.

| **[DenseAnnotate: Enabling Scalable Dense Caption Collection for Images and 3D Scenes via Spoken Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12452v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse applications, there is a pressing need for task-centered, high-quality training data. A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes. We curate a human-annotated multi-modal dataset of 3,531 images, 898 3D scenes, and 7,460 3D objects, with audio-aligned dense annotations in 20 languages, including 8,746 image captions, 2,000 scene captions, and 19,000 object captions. Models trained on this dataset exhibit improvements of 5% in multilingual, 47% in cultural alignment, and 54% in 3D spatial capabilities. Our results show that our platform offers a feasible approach for future vision-language research and can be applied to various tasks and diverse types of data.</p></details> |  | None |

This reliability gap arises when models attend to spurious regions and when retraining or additional labels are impractical at deployment time. We address this setting with CoTBox-TTT, an evidence-first test-time training approach that adapts a vision-language model at inference while keeping all backbones frozen. The method updates only a small set of continuous soft prompts. It identifies question-relevant regions through a visual chain-of-thought signal and encourages answer consistency across the original image and a localized crop. The procedure is label free, and plug and play with diverse backbones. Experiments on medical VQA show that the approach is practical for real deployments. For instance, adding CoTBox-TTT to LLaVA increases closed-ended accuracy by 12.3% on pathVQA.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion Vision-Language Models (DVLMs) are particularly attractive because they enable parallel token decoding, but the large number of visual tokens still significantly hinders their inference efficiency. While visual token pruning has been extensively studied for autoregressive VLMs (AVLMs), it remains largely unexplored for DVLMs. In this work, we propose RedVTP, a response-driven visual token pruning strategy that leverages the inference dynamics of DVLMs. Our method estimates visual token importance using attention from the masked response tokens. Based on the observation that these importance scores remain consistent across steps, RedVTP prunes the less important visual tokens from the masked tokens after the first inference step, thereby maximizing inference efficiency. Experiments show that RedVTP improves token generation throughput of LLaDA-V and LaViDa by up to 186% and 28.05%, respectively, and reduces inference latency by up to 64.97% and 21.87%, without compromising-and in some cases improving-accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6page...</summary><p>6pages,3 figures.Uunder review of International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications</p></details> | None |

Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%.

Moreover, they tend to be object centric and struggle with complex and intricate scenes. Conversely, 3D-free methods can generate text-controlled views of complex, in-the-wild scenes using a pretrained stable diffusion model without the need for a large amount of 3D-based training data, but lack camera control. In this paper, we introduce a method capable of generating camera-controlled viewpoints from a single input image, by combining the benefits of 3D-free and 3D-based approaches. Our method excels in handling complex and diverse scenes without extensive training or additional 3D and multiview data. It leverages widely available pretrained NVS models for weak guidance, integrating this knowledge into a 3D-free view synthesis style approach, along with enriching the CLIP vision-language space with 3D camera angle information, to achieve the desired results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, achieving high-fidelity, consistent novel view synthesis at desired camera angles across a wide variety of scenes while maintaining accurate, natural detail representation and image clarity across various viewpoints. We also support our method with a comprehensive analysis of 2D image generation models and the 3D space, providing a solid foundation and rationale for our solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), AAAI 2026 Workshop on AI for Environmental Science (AI4ES).

Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval. Our experiments on a real-world robotic platform demonstrate strong generalization and exploratory performance in unstructured, unseen environments, even with limited data.

| **[Reasoning under Vision: Understanding Visual-Spatial Cognition in Vision-Language Models for CAPTCHA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06067v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures | None |

These models, like GPT, can be adapted to various applications such as question answering and visual understanding, outperforming task-specific AI models and earning their name due to broad applicability across fields. The development of biomedical foundation models marks a significant milestone in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand complex biological phenomena and advance medical research and practice. This survey explores the potential of foundation models in diverse domains within biomedical fields, including computational biology, drug discovery and development, clinical informatics, medical imaging, and public health.

Existing methods have progressed to handling explicit queries where the visual content of interest is described explicitly; however, they fail with implicit queries where identifying videos relevant to the query requires reasoning. We introduce reasoning text-to-video retrieval, a paradigm that extends traditional retrieval to process implicit queries through reasoning while providing object-level grounding masks that identify which entities satisfy the query conditions. Instead of relying on vision-language models directly, we propose representing video content as digital twins, i.e., structured scene representations that decompose salient objects through specialist vision models. This approach is beneficial because it enables large language models to reason directly over long-horizon video content without visual token compression. Specifically, our two-stage framework first performs compositional alignment between decomposed sub-queries and digital twin representations for candidate identification, then applies large language model-based reasoning with just-in-time refinement that invokes additional specialist models to address information gaps. We construct a benchmark of 447 manually created implicit queries with 135 videos (ReasonT2VBench-135) and another more challenging version of 1000 videos (ReasonT2VBench-1000). Our method achieves 81.2% R@1 on ReasonT2VBench-135, outperforming the strongest baseline by greater than 50 percentage points, and maintains 81.7% R@1 on the extended configuration while establishing state-of-the-art results in three conventional benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX).</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 fi...</summary><p>v3 fixes some typos from v2</p></details> | None |
| **[SpaceVLM: Sub-Space Modeling of Negation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12331v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with negation. Given a prompt like "retrieve (or generate) a street scene without pedestrians," they often fail to respect the "not." Existing methods address this limitation by fine-tuning on large negation datasets, but such retraining often compromises the model's zero-shot performance on affirmative prompts. We show that the embedding space of VLMs, such as CLIP, can be divided into semantically consistent subspaces. Based on this property, we propose a training-free framework that models negation as a subspace in the joint embedding space rather than a single point (Figure 1). To find the matching image for a caption such as "A but not N," we construct two spherical caps around the embeddings of A and N, and we score images by the central direction of the region that is close to A and far from N. Across retrieval, MCQ, and text-to-image tasks, our method improves negation understanding by about 30% on average over prior methods. It closes the gap between affirmative and negated prompts while preserving the zero-shot performance that fine-tuned models fail to maintain. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SVBench: A Benchmark with Temporal Multi-Turn Dialogues for Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10810v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on established benchmarks, there remains a notable gap in suitable evaluation regarding their applicability in the emerging domain of long-context streaming video understanding. Current benchmarks for video understanding typically emphasize isolated single-instance text inputs and fail to evaluate the capacity to sustain temporal reasoning throughout the entire duration of video streams. To address these limitations, we introduce SVBench, a pioneering benchmark with temporal multi-turn question-answering chains specifically designed to thoroughly assess the capabilities of streaming video understanding of current LVLMs. We design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to obtain 49,979 Question-Answer (QA) pairs of 1,353 streaming videos, which includes generating QA chains that represent a series of consecutive multi-turn dialogues over video segments and constructing temporal linkages between successive QA chains. Our experimental results, obtained from 14 models in dialogue and streaming evaluations, reveal that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source LVLMs struggle with long-context streaming video understanding. We also construct a StreamingChat model, which significantly outperforms open-source LVLMs on our SVBench and achieves comparable performance on diverse vision-language benchmarks. We expect SVBench to advance the research of streaming video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of current LVLMs. Our benchmark and model can be accessed at https://github.com/sotayang/SVBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Accepted (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/sotayang/SVBench) |

However, most existing efforts remain limited to single-modality inputs and channel-specific objec- tives, overlooking the broader potential of large foundation models for unified wireless sensing. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSense, a multi-modal, multi-task foundation model that jointly addresses channel-centric, environment-aware, and human-centered sensing. Our framework integrates image, radar, LiDAR, and textual data by transforming them into vision- compatible representations, enabling effective cross-modal align- ment within a unified feature space. A modality gating mecha- nism adaptively fuses these representations, while a vision-based large language model backbone enables unified feature align- ment and instruction-driven task adaptation. Furthermore, task- specific sequential attention and uncertainty-based loss weighting mechanisms enhance cross-task generalization. Experiments on real wireless scenario datasets show that our approach outper- forms both task-specific and large-model baselines, confirming its strong generalization across heterogeneous sensing tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[D$^{3}$ToM: Decider-Guided Dynamic Token Merging for Accelerating Diffusion MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12280v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance.

Existing dynamic resolution and token pruning methods are constrained by a passive perception paradigm, suffering from increased redundancy when obtaining finer visual inputs. In this work, we explore a new active perception paradigm that enables models to revisit information-rich regions. First, we present LRS-GRO, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for active perception in UHR RS processing, encompassing 17 question types across global, region, and object levels, annotated via a semi-automatic pipeline. Building on LRS-GRO, we propose ZoomEarth, an adaptive cropping-zooming framework with a novel Region-Guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), ZoomEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance on LRS-GRO and, in the zero-shot setting, on three public UHR remote sensing benchmarks. Furthermore, ZoomEarth can be seamlessly integrated with downstream models for tasks such as cloud removal, denoising, segmentation, and image editing through simple tool interfaces, demonstrating strong versatility and extensibility.</p></details> |  | None |

A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures | None |

Despite recent advances, existing approaches often lack sufficient disease-awareness in visual representations and adequate vision-language alignment to meet the specialized requirements of medical image analysis. As a result, these models usually overlook critical pathological features on chest X-rays and struggle to generate clinically accurate reports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stage disease-aware framework for chest X-ray report generation. In Stage~1, our model learns Disease-Aware Semantic Tokens (DASTs) corresponding to specific pathology categories through cross-attention mechanisms and multi-label classification, while simultaneously aligning vision and language representations via contrastive learning. In Stage~2, we introduce a Disease-Visual Attention Fusion (DVAF) module to integrate disease-aware representations with visual features, along with a Dual-Modal Similarity Retrieval (DMSR) mechanism that combines visual and disease-specific similarities to retrieve relevant exemplars, providing contextual guidance during report generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., CheXpert Plus, IU X-ray, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that our disease-aware framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in chest X-ray report generation, with significant improvements in clinical accuracy and linguistic quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

To meet this demand, we present Fusionista2.0, a streamlined video retrieval system optimized for speed and usability.

Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization.

To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

While fully supervised SGG has improved steadily, it suffers from training bias due to limited curated data and long-tail predicate distributions, leading to poor predicate diversity and degraded downstream performance. We present PRISM-0, a zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG framework that leverages foundation models in a bottom-up pipeline to capture a broad spectrum of predicates. Detected object pairs are filtered, described via a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate fine- and coarse-grained predicates, which are then validated by a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. PRISM-0 modular, dataset-independent design enriches existing SGG datasets such as Visual Genome and produces diverse, unbiased graphs. While operating entirely in a zero-shot setting, PRISM-0 achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised models on SGG benchmarks and even state-of-the-art supervised methods in tasks such as Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF), a lightweight, training-free method to suppress such hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of the model's representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we propose FaNe, a semantic-enhanced VLP framework. To mitigate false negatives, we introduce a semantic-aware positive pair mining strategy based on text-text similarity with adaptive normalization. Furthermore, we design a text-conditioned sparse attention pooling module to enable fine-grained image-text alignment through localized visual representations guided by textual cues. To strengthen intra-modal discrimination, we develop a hard-negative aware contrastive loss that adaptively reweights semantically similar negatives. Extensive experiments on five downstream medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FaNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, validating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

This work is the first study to address a key research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel, fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible. Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main (21pgs, 12 Tables, 9 Figures)</p></details> | None |

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures | None |

Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing missing-aware prompt methods help reduce this degradation, but they still rely on conventional prediction heads (e.g., a Fully-Connected layer) that compute class scores in the same way regardless of which modality is present or absent. We introduce Decoupled Prototype Learning (DPL), a new prediction head architecture that explicitly adjusts its decision process to the observed input modalities. For each class, DPL selects a set of prototypes specific to the current missing-modality cases (image-missing, text-missing, or mixed-missing). Each prototype is then decomposed into image-specific and text-specific components, enabling the head to make decisions that depend on the information actually present. This adaptive design allows DPL to handle inputs with missing modalities more effectively while remaining fully compatible with existing prompt-based frameworks. Extensive experiments on MM-IMDb, UPMC Food-101, and Hateful Memes demonstrate that DPL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all widely used multimodal imag-text datasets and various missing cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates to v1.

| **[Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering with Structured Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06638v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. Recent work has introduced its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source and answers are produced without external retrieval. Existing IK-KVQA approaches, however, are typically trained with answer-only supervision: reasoning remains implicit, justifications are often weak or inconsistent, and generalization after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can be brittle. We propose MODELNAME, a framework that equips IK-KVQA with dual-path structured reasoning traces (symbolic relation paths over text and vision together with path-grounded natural-language explanations) to provide a stronger inductive bias than generic answer-only supervision. These traces act as modality-aware scaffolds that guide the model toward relevant entities and attributes, offering more structure than generic chain-of-thought supervision while not constraining reasoning to any single fixed path. Using a single open-source MLLM, MODELNAME constructs and selects traces to build an offline trace-enriched dataset and then performs structure-aware self-distillation; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases are used, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, MODELNAME consistently improves both answer accuracy and the transparency of intermediate reasoning, achieving up to 11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoupled Action Head: Confining Task Knowledge to Conditioning Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12101v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior Cloning (BC) is a data-driven supervised learning approach that has gained increasing attention with the success of scaling laws in language and vision domains. Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Point Cloud Quantization through Multimodal Prompting for 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12079v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector quantization has emerged as a powerful tool in large-scale multimodal models, unifying heterogeneous representations through discrete token encoding. However, its effectiveness hinges on robust codebook design. Current prototype-based approaches relying on trainable vectors or clustered centroids fall short in representativeness and interpretability, even as multimodal alignment demonstrates its promise in vision-language models. To address these limitations, we propose a simple multimodal prompting-driven quantization framework for point cloud analysis. Our methodology is built upon two core insights: 1) Text embeddings from pre-trained models inherently encode visual semantics through many-to-one contrastive alignment, naturally serving as robust prototype priors; and 2) Multimodal prompts enable adaptive refinement of these prototypes, effectively mitigating vision-language semantic gaps. The framework introduces a dual-constrained quantization space, enforced by compactness and separation regularization, which seamlessly integrates visual and prototype features, resulting in hybrid representations that jointly encode geometric and semantic information. Furthermore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to achieve differentiable discretization while maintaining quantization sparsity. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets clearly demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026. 11 pages, 7 figures.

Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

Art conveys emotion through the joint design of visual and auditory elements, yet most prior work is human-centered or single-modality, overlooking the emotion intentionally expressed by the artwork. Meanwhile, current Audio-Visual Language Models (AVLMs) typically require large-scale audio pretraining to endow Visual Language Models (VLMs) with hearing, which limits scalability. We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs. VAEmotionLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ArtEmoBenchmark, outperforming audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual baselines. Ablations show that the proposed components are complementary.</p></details> |  | None |

In the paper, we devise a ''filter-correlate-compress'' framework to accelerate the MLLM by systematically optimizing multimodal context length during prefilling. The framework first implements FiCoCo-V, a training-free method operating within the vision encoder. It employs a redundancy-based token discard mechanism that uses a novel integrated metric to accurately filter out redundant visual tokens. To mitigate information loss, the framework introduces a correlation-based information recycling mechanism that allows preserved tokens to selectively recycle information from correlated discarded tokens with a self-preserving compression, thereby preventing the dilution of their own core content. The framework's FiCoCo-L variant further leverages task-aware textual priors to perform token reduction directly within the LLM decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the FiCoCo series effectively accelerates a range of MLLMs, achieves up to 14.7x FLOPs reduction with 93.6% performance retention. Our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art training-free approaches, showcasing effectiveness and generalizability across model architectures, sizes, and tasks without requiring retraining.

Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations. In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\% loss on VBench).</p></details> |  | None |

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

While existing surgical tracking datasets provide coordinate information, they lack the semantic context necessary to understand tracking failure mechanisms. We introduce VL-SurgPT, the first large-scale multimodal dataset that bridges visual tracking with textual descriptions of point status in surgical scenes. The dataset comprises 908 in vivo video clips, including 754 for tissue tracking (17,171 annotated points across five challenging scenarios) and 154 for instrument tracking (covering seven instrument types with detailed keypoint annotations). We establish comprehensive benchmarks using eight state-of-the-art tracking methods and propose TG-SurgPT, a text-guided tracking approach that leverages semantic descriptions to improve robustness in visually challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating point status information significantly improves tracking accuracy and reliability, particularly in adverse visual scenarios where conventional vision-only methods struggle. By bridging visual and linguistic modalities, VL-SurgPT enables the development of context-aware tracking systems crucial for advancing computer-assisted surgery applications that can maintain performance even under challenging intraoperative conditions.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 oral | None |

We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce Image-POSER, a reflective reinforcement learning framework that (i) orchestrates a diverse registry of pretrained text-to-image and image-to-image experts, (ii) handles long-form prompts end-to-end through dynamic task decomposition, and (iii) supervises alignment at each step via structured feedback from a vision-language model critic. By casting image synthesis and editing as a Markov Decision Process, we learn non-trivial expert pipelines that adaptively combine strengths across models. Experiments show that Image-POSER outperforms baselines, including frontier models, across industry-standard and custom benchmarks in alignment, fidelity, and aesthetics, and is consistently preferred in human evaluations. These results highlight that reinforcement learning can endow AI systems with the capacity to autonomously decompose, reorder, and combine visual models, moving towards general-purpose visual assistants.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.</p></details> | Poster of AAAI'2026 | None |

The Double-Edged Sword of Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12001v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanations are often promoted as tools for transparency, but they can also foster confirmation bias; users may assume reasoning is correct whenever outputs appear acceptable. We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust.

| **[From Classification to Cross-Modal Understanding: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Renal Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11984v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained glomerular subtyping is central to kidney biopsy interpretation, but clinically valuable labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> | None |
| **[Seeing the Forest and the Trees: Query-Aware Tokenizer for Long-Video Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11910v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage. Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence. We will make all code, data, and trained models' weights publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab) |

Traditional benchmarks evaluate what models can answer correctly, not why they succeed or fail. In this work, we perform a failure-mode analysis of six frontier VLMs on three physics-based benchmarks - Physion, Physion++, and CLEVRER - by introducing custom subtests (for Physion and Physion++) and an integration of existing benchmark categories (for CLEVRER) to factor benchmark performance into distinct, testable capabilities. These subtests isolate perception (object, color, and occlusion recognition) and physics understanding (motion prediction and spatial reasoning), enabling us to test whether models attend to the correct entities and dynamics underlying their answers. Counterintuitively, subtest mastery correlates only weakly with benchmark accuracy: models often answer correctly without grounding in perception or physics. This suggests that current VLMs sometimes achieve benchmark scores for the wrong reasons, underscoring the need for diagnostics that expose hidden failure modes beyond aggregate metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

Among these, the field of Machine Learning (ML) has thrived by leveraging data to extract meaningful insights. However, ML techniques face notable challenges when dealing with real-world data, often due to issues of imbalance, noise, insufficient labeling, and high dimensionality. To address these limitations, some researchers advocate for the adoption of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a statistical approach that discerningly captures the intrinsic shape of data despite noise. Despite its potential, TDA has not gained as much traction within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain compared to structurally distinct areas like computer vision. Nevertheless, a dedicated community of researchers has been exploring the application of TDA in NLP, yielding 100 papers we comprehensively survey in this paper. Our findings categorize these efforts into theoretical and non-theoretical approaches. Theoretical approaches aim to explain linguistic phenomena from a topological viewpoint, while non-theoretical approaches merge TDA with ML features, utilizing diverse numerical representation techniques. We conclude by exploring the challenges and unresolved questions that persist in this niche field.

Such unauthorized model merging not only violates intellectual property rights but also undermines model ownership and accountability. To address this issue, we present MergeGuard, a proactive dual-stage weight protection framework that disrupts merging compatibility while maintaining task fidelity. In the first stage, we redistribute task-relevant information across layers via L2-regularized optimization, ensuring that important gradients are evenly dispersed. In the second stage, we inject structured perturbations to misalign task subspaces, breaking curvature compatibility in the loss landscape. Together, these stages reshape the model's parameter geometry such that merged models collapse into destructive interference while the protected model remains fully functional. Extensive experiments on both vision (ViT-L-14) and language (Llama2, Gemma2, Mistral) models demonstrate that MergeGuard reduces merged model accuracy by up to 90% with less than 1.5% performance loss on the protected model.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, under review</p></details> | None |
| **[TopoPerception: A Shortcut-Free Evaluation of Global Visual Perception in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11831v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically align visual features from an encoder with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception) |

This paper shares our experiences building an ear-mounted voice-and-vision wearable that performs local AI inference using a paired smartphone as a trusted personal edge. We describe the hardware--software co-design of this privacy-preserving system, including challenges in integrating a camera, microphone, and speaker within a 30-gram form factor, enabling wake word-triggered capture, and running quantized vision-language and large-language models entirely offline. Through iterative prototyping, we identify key design hurdles in power budgeting, connectivity, latency, and social acceptability. Our initial evaluation shows that fully local multimodal inference is feasible on commodity mobile hardware with interactive latency. We conclude with design lessons for researchers developing embedded AI systems that balance privacy, responsiveness, and usability in everyday settings.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

This convergence enables machines to perceive, reason and interact with complex environments through natural language and spatial understanding, bridging the gap between linguistic intelligence and spatial perception. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies. We first introduce the foundational principles of LLMs and 3D data representations, followed by an in-depth examination of 3D sensing technologies critical for robotics. The review then explores key advancements in scene understanding, text-to-3D generation, object grounding and embodied agents, highlighting cutting-edge techniques such as zero-shot 3D segmentation, dynamic scene synthesis and language-guided manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, including adaptive model architectures, enhanced cross-modal alignment and real-time processing capabilities, which pave the way for more intelligent, context-aware and autonomous robotic sensing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 15 figures, MDPI Sensors Journal</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE) |
| **[Collaborative Representation Learning for Alignment of Tactile, Language, and Vision Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11512v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PAS : Prelim Attention Score for Detecting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11502v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Progression of Memory State in Robotic Manipulation: An Object-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11478v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Metric Learning Encoding Models: A Multivariate Framework for Interpreting Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11608v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how explicit theoretical features are encoded in opaque neural systems is a central challenge now common to neuroscience and AI. We introduce Metric Learning Encoding Models (MLEMs) to address this challenge most directly as a metric learning problem: we fit the distance in the space of theoretical features to match the distance in neural space. Our framework improves on univariate encoding and decoding methods by building on second-order isomorphism methods, such as Representational Similarity Analysis, and extends them by learning a metric that efficiently models feature as well as interactions between them. The effectiveness of MLEM is validated through two sets of simulations. First, MLEMs recover ground-truth importance features in synthetic datasets better than state-of-the-art methods, such as Feature Reweighted RSA (FR-RSA). Second, we deploy MLEMs on real language data, where they show stronger robustness to noise in calculating the importance of linguistic features (gender, tense, etc.). MLEMs are applicable to any domains where theoretical features can be identified, such as language, vision, audition, etc. We release optimized code applicable to measure feature importance in the representations of any artificial neural networks or empirical neural data at https://github.com/LouisJalouzot/MLEM.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/LouisJalouzot/MLEM) |

It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes.

| **[From Synthetic Scenes to Real Performance: Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11440v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.</p></details> |  | None |

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, which includes all technical appendices and additional experimental details</p></details> | None |
| **[BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement. The benchmark and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/cydxf/Q-Doc.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/cydxf/Q-Doc) |
| **[Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The First Workshop on Confabulation, Hallucinations, & Overgeneration in Multilingual & Precision-critical Setting - AACL-IJCNLP2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Adaptive Cache Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07570v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Under review</p></details> | None |

Although several foundation models for biomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on certain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen domain data. We owe the deficiency to lack of vision-language knowledge before segmentation. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us to leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling vision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that seamlessly uses MLLMs to guide SAM in learning microscopy cross-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy, named uLLSAM. Specifically, we propose the Vision-Language Semantic Alignment (VLSA) module, which injects VLK into Segment Anything Model (SAM). We find that after SAM receives global VLK prompts, its performance improves significantly, but there are deficiencies in boundary contour perception. Therefore, we further propose Semantic Boundary Regularization (SBR) to regularize SAM. Our method achieves performance improvements of 11.8% in SA across 9 in-domain microscopy datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our method also demonstrates improvements of 9.2% in SA across 10 out-of-domain datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

| **[EcoAlign: An Economically Rational Framework for Efficient LVLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11301v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Flatlands: Unlocking Spatial Intelligence by Decoupling 3D Reasoning from Numerical Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11239v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.</p></details> |  | None |

This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Explainable Deep Convolutional Multi-Type Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11165v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.</p></details> |  | None |

We examine these failures through the lens of uncertainty, focusing on contextual incongruity, where objects appear unexpectedly or fail to appear in expected contexts, and show that such cases increase recognition difficulty for state-of-the-art LVLMs. To study this regime, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context (ORIC) framework, which constructs incongruous object-context pairs through two complementary strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify hard-to-recognize objects present in the image and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to mine plausible but absent ones. Applied to MSCOCO, ORIC produces ORIC-Bench and ORIC-style training data. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and 2 open-vocabulary detectors reveals substantial performance drops and bias patterns under incongruous contexts. Fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct with Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning on 600 ORIC-style samples improves results on ORIC-Bench, AMBER, and HallusionBench. Overall, we show that contextual incongruity is a key source of uncertainty and provide tools for more reliable LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoyangLi-1/ORIC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZhaoyangLi-1/ORIC) |

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets. This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.</p></details> |  | None |

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we introduce MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with agent-wise adaptive Test-time scaling that pioneers a paradigm shift to procedural scaling, adapting dynamically to the functional entities of visual documents understanding and reasoning. MACT decomposes the visual document processing flow into four specialized agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer, to resolve cognitive overload and introduce a critical self-correction loop for factual grounding. This collaborative architecture is amplified by an agent-wise adaptive test-time scaling strategy that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the complexity and redundancy of each functionality. Evaluated on multiple visual document understanding benchmarks, MACT achieves superior performance with a smaller parameter scale, adapting effectively to various document scenarios without compromising its general or mathematical reasoning capabilities. The three variants of MACT consistently attain top-three average performance rankings, with average performance enhancements of 9.9-11.5% over the base models.

While several existing training-free decoding strategies have achieved considerable success, they still suffer from inherent limitations. Many are computationally prohibitive, requiring multiple forward passes through the entire LVLM, while others rely on indirect, heuristic-based proxies that are unreliable correlates for a direct semantic conflict. We propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{L}ogits \textbf{C}alibration (DLC), a novel training-free framework that is the first to cure semantic drift in a direct, dynamic, and efficient manner. At each decoding step, DLC introduces a real-time visual referee that performs a dual-aspect visual alignment check: (1) it assesses the intrinsic visual relevance of a candidate token and (2) its contextual visual coherence. By dynamically balancing these two checks and evaluating them against an adaptive baseline, DLC surgically modulates the output logits to favor grounded tokens. Extensive experiments show DLC significantly outperforms existing methods in mitigating hallucinations while, crucially, maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding costly multiple LVLM forward passes. Our work presents a powerful and practical solution for building more reliable and visually-grounded LVLMs. Code will be released on https://github.com/JiaheChen2002/DLC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/JiaheChen2002/DLC) |

Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.</p></details> |  | None |

Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in improving the personalization capabilities of VLMs. To better integrate user-provided concepts into VLMs, many methods use positive and negative samples to fine-tune these models. However, the scarcity of user-provided positive samples and the low quality of retrieved negative samples pose challenges for existing techniques. To reveal the relationship between sample and model performance, we systematically investigate the amount and diversity impact of positive and negative samples (easy and hard) on VLM personalization tasks. Based on the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents a concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive and negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity, and can be easily extended to multi-concept scenarios. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT framework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful pipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization baselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of positive samples and the low quality of negative samples.

| **[Text-guided Weakly Supervised Framework for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10958v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Abstract 3D Perception for Spatial Intelligence in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10946v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OmniVGGT: Omni-Modality Driven Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10560v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-official/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-official) |
| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks involving single images or short videos, they still struggle with Long Video Question Answering (LVQA) due to its demand for complex multi-step temporal reasoning. Vanilla approaches, which simply sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM along with the question, incur significant token overhead. This forces aggressive downsampling of long videos, causing models to miss fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, and key temporal cues. Recent works attempt to overcome these limitations through heuristic approaches; however, they lack explicit mechanisms for encoding temporal relationships and fail to provide any formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic required by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA first translates a natural language question into a logic specification that models the temporal relationship between frame-level events. Next, we construct a video automaton to model the video's frame-by-frame event progression, and finally employ model checking to compare the automaton against the specification to identify all video segments that satisfy the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on the LongVideoBench and CinePile LVQA benchmarks show that NeuS-QA significantly improves performance by over 10%, particularly on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step reasoning. We open-source our code at https://utaustin-swarmlab.github.io/NeuS-QA/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://utaustin-swarmlab.github.io/NeuS-QA) |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (oral) | None |

In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval.

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10627v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</p></details> |  | None |

To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  | None |

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic ADMM for Deep Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10784v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, revolutionizing various sectors worldwide. The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA (Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on a bounded region, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables the proposed algorithm to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Moreover, the algorithmic architecture enables scalable parallel computing and supports various preconditions, such as second-order information, second moment, and orthogonalized momentum by Newton-Schulz iterations. Incorporating the latter two preconditions in PISA yields two computationally efficient variants: SISA and NSISA. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse deep models, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate superior numerical performance of SISA and NSISA compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Facial-R1: Aligning Reasoning and Recognition for Facial Emotion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10254v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026. 16 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.</p></details> |  | None |

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://layerpeeler.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

Humans naturally ground concrete semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Although prior work has introduced diverse environment representations to improve reasoning, auxiliary modalities are often naively concatenated with RGB features, which underutilizes each modality's distinct contribution. We propose a hierarchical Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to enable agents to perceive and ground environments at multiple scales. Specifically, the Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module supports local action prediction by generating view-level descriptions, capturing fine-grained semantics and narrowing the modality gap between instructions and environments. Complementarily, the Depth Enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally builds a trajectory-level depth exploration map, providing a coarse-grained representation of global spatial layout. Extensive experiments show that the hierarchical representation enrichment of SUSA significantly improves navigation performance over the baseline on discrete VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON) and generalizes better to the continuous R2R-CE benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2026, I14 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current methods often depend on large replay buffers or heavily annotated datasets which are impractical due to storage, privacy, and cost constraints. We propose CLTS (Continual Learning via Text-Image Synergy), a novel class-incremental framework that mitigates forgetting without storing real task data. CLTS leverages pre-trained vision-language models, BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) for caption generation and stable diffusion for sample generation. Each task is handled by a dedicated Task Head, while a Task Router learns to assign inputs to the correct Task Head using the generated data. On three benchmark datasets, CLTS improves average task accuracy by up to 54% and achieves 63 times better memory efficiency compared to four recent continual learning baselines, demonstrating improved retention and adaptability. CLTS introduces a novel perspective by integrating generative text-image augmentation for scalable continual learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the revised and peer-reviewed version of our paper, accepted and published in the Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> | None |

These tasks pose unique challenges, including severe domain gaps, limited training data, and the lack of descriptive language annotations. To handle this dilemma, we extracted the latent scientific phenomena knowledge and further proposed a fresh framework that teaches video diffusion models to generate scientific phenomena from a single initial frame. Particularly, static knowledge is extracted via pre-trained masked autoencoders, while dynamic knowledge is derived from pre-trained optical flow prediction. Subsequently, based on the aligned spatial relations between the CLIP vision and language encoders, the visual embeddings of scientific phenomena, guided by latent scientific phenomena knowledge, are projected to generate the pseudo-language prompt embeddings in both spatial and frequency domains. By incorporating these prompts and fine-tuning the video diffusion model, we enable the generation of videos that better adhere to scientific laws. Extensive experiments on both computational fluid dynamics simulations and real-world typhoon observations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior fidelity and consistency across diverse scientific scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate this, we propose LISA, a Layer-wise Integration and Suppression Approach. LISA leverages the layer-wise functional roles in MLLMs: shallow layers provide visual grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify spurious signals. First, layer-wise spectral modulation stabilizes attention by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6% in $\text{CHAIR}_\text{I}$ and improves POPE F1 by up to 5.1%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, AAAI26 conference Camera-Ready</p></details> | None |

Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. However, building a trainable sampling method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling in Video-MLLMs. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization for the temporal sampling policy. Furthermore, we propose a dual-style long video training data construction pipeline, balancing comprehensive temporal understanding and key segment localization. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO) |
| **[MCM: Multi-layer Concept Map for Efficient Concept Learning from Masked Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00266v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masking strategies commonly employed in natural language processing are still underexplored in vision tasks such as concept learning, where conventional methods typically rely on full images. However, using masked images diversifies perceptual inputs, potentially offering significant advantages in concept learning with large-scale Transformer models. To this end, we propose Multi-layer Concept Map (MCM), the first work to devise an efficient concept learning method based on masked images. In particular, we introduce an asymmetric concept learning architecture by establishing correlations between different encoder and decoder layers, updating concept tokens using backward gradients from reconstruction tasks. The learned concept tokens at various levels of granularity help either reconstruct the masked image patches by filling in gaps or guide the reconstruction results in a direction that reflects specific concepts. Moreover, we present both quantitative and qualitative results across a wide range of metrics, demonstrating that MCM significantly reduces computational costs by training on fewer than 75% of the total image patches while enhancing concept prediction performance. Additionally, editing specific concept tokens in the latent space enables targeted image generation from masked images, aligning both the visible contextual patches and the provided concepts. By further adjusting the testing time mask ratio, we could produce a range of reconstructions that blend the visible patches with the provided concepts, proportional to the chosen ratios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HCC-3D: Hierarchical Compensatory Compression for 98% 3D Token Reduction in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09883v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Remember Me: Bridging the Long-Range Gap in LVLMs with Three-Step Inference-Only Decay Resilience Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09868v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

| **[WOD-E2E: Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving in Challenging Long-tail Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26125v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.</p></details> |  | None |
