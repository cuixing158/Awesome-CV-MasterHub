Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</p></details> | 51 pages, 15 figures | None |

However, conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information. Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets, demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization in Point Clouds with Vision-Language Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14346v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a 3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions captured by the head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment with vision-language guidance. By assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. The learning process is enhanced using concurrently collected vision and language signals to improve multimodal alignment. The learned encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action recognition baselines.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |
| **[The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SpecBPP: A Self-Supervised Learning Approach for Hyperspectral Representation and Soil Organic Carbon Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19781v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19, significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.</p></details> |  | None |

We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

| **[On the robustness of modeling grounded word learning through a child's egocentric input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14749v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024) showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over 500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's developmental experiences.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wavelet Logic Machines: Learning and Reasoning in the Spectral Domain Without Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19514v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets. Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to spectral sparsity priors. In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost. This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design without overparameterized architectures.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BeetleVerse: A Study on Taxonomic Classification of Ground Beetles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13393v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator, making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97% accuracy at genus and 94% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (Workshop CV4Animals: Computer Vision for Animal Behavior Tracking and Modeling)</p></details> | None |
| **[Vision-and-Language Training Helps Deploy Taxonomic Knowledge but Does Not Fundamentally Alter It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13328v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aligning Information Capacity Between Vision and Language via Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distillation for Image-Text Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14953v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling Visual Semantic Models to effectively handle multi-view description matching has been a longstanding challenge. Existing methods typically learn a set of embeddings to find the optimal match for each view's text and compute similarity. However, the visual and text embeddings learned through these approaches have limited information capacity and are prone to interference from locally similar negative samples. To address this issue, we argue that the information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation. Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of sparse text embeddings. Our proposed D2S-VSE model is extensively evaluated on the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking the Embodied Gap in Vision-and-Language Navigation: A Holistic Study of Physical and Visual Disparities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13019v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

| **[Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the bouba-kiki effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10013v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba" with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07984v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01628v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce harmonic loss as an alternative supervisory signal for training neural networks and large language models (LLMs). Harmonic loss differs from standard cross-entropy loss by (a) replacing the usual SoftMax normalization with a scale-invariant HarMax function and (b) computing logits via Euclidean distance rather than a dot product. Harmonic loss enables improved interpretability and faster convergence, owing to its scale invariance and finite convergence point by design, which can be interpreted as a class center. We first validate the performance of harmonic models across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss perform better than standard models by: (a) enhancing interpretability, (b) requiring less data for generalization, and (c) reducing grokking. Moreover, we compare a GPT-2 model trained with harmonic loss to the standard GPT-2, illustrating that the harmonic model develops more interpretable representations. Looking forward, we believe harmonic loss may become a valuable tool in domains with limited data availability or in high-stakes applications where interpretability and reliability are paramount, paving the way for more robust and efficient neural network models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures; The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> | None |
| **[EPIC: Efficient Prompt Interaction for Text-Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07415v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC). Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach, our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.14856</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, has been accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator, departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance) preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3 minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3 incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module, accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task performance.</p></details> | 20pages, 11pages | None |

Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain higher-quality annotations.

| **[Fair Domain Generalization: An Information-Theoretic View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05823v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.</p></details> |  | None |

While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

| **[From Vision To Language through Graph of Events in Space and Time: An Explainable Self-supervised Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04815v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and explainable video description generation process can function as a fully automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2501.08460</p></details> | None |
| **[UniAud: A Unified Auditing Framework for High Auditing Power and Utility with One Training Run](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04457v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private (DP) optimization has been widely adopted as a standard approach to provide rigorous privacy guarantees for training datasets. DP auditing verifies whether a model trained with DP optimization satisfies its claimed privacy level by estimating empirical privacy lower bounds through hypothesis testing. Recent O(1) frameworks improve auditing efficiency by checking the membership status of multiple audit samples in a single run, rather than checking individual samples across multiple runs. However, we reveal that there is no free lunch for this improved efficiency: data dependency and an implicit conflict between auditing and utility impair the tightness of the auditing results. Addressing these challenges, our key insights include reducing data dependency through uncorrelated data and resolving the auditing-utility conflict by decoupling the criteria for effective auditing and separating objectives for utility and auditing. We first propose a unified framework, UniAud, for data-independent auditing that maximizes auditing power through a novel uncorrelated canary construction and a self-comparison framework. We then extend this framework as UniAud++ for data-dependent auditing, optimizing the auditing and utility trade-off through multi-task learning with separate objectives for auditing and training. Experimental results validate that our black-box O(1) framework matches the state-of-the-art auditing results of O(T) auditing with thousands of runs, demonstrating the best efficiency-auditing trade-off across vision and language tasks. Additionally, our framework provides meaningful auditing with only slight utility degradation compared to standard DP training, showing the optimal utility-auditing trade-off and the benefit of requiring no extra training for auditing.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

This allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection, aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering, intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework, it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent.

Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \& Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG) and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

It remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further, this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have successfully proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving 15.9% and 12.5% improvements (absolute) in Oracle Success Rate (OSR) on AerialVLN-S dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of large-scale MLLMs (l-MLLMs) limit their use in resource-constrained scenarios. Although small-scale MLLMs (s-MLLMs) are designed to reduce computational costs, they typically suffer from performance degradation. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to transfer teacher model's robust representations across both visual and linguistic modalities, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer teacher model's ability to capture visual token relationships. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of the proposed distillation strategy: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to strengthen the alignment between visual-linguistic representations in s-MLLMs, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the s-MLLMs with multimodal understanding capacity, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to refine s-MLLM's knowledge. Our approach significantly improves s-MLLMs performance without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.</p></details> | 70 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

Existing MoE frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER, tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of activated experts for these tokens.

This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found." Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with publicly available, open-weight models.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field.

DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.</p></details> | 36 pages, 25 figures | None |

Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful.

However, their application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels. Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including reference pages, 7 tables, and 6 figures</p></details> | None |

Spurious correlations in visual data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization, and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21144v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NaLaFormer: Norm-Aware Linear Attention for Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21137v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction, current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$ normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets.

In this work, we evaluate the extent to which vision-and-language models (VLMs) are compatible with humans when producing or judging the appropriateness of vague quantifiers in visual contexts. We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025, 10 pages</p></details> | None |
| **[World-Consistent Data Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06413v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires an agent to navigate through photorealistic environments following natural-language instructions. One main obstacle existing in VLN is data scarcity, leading to poor generalization performance over unseen environments. Though data argumentation is a promising way for scaling up the dataset, how to generate VLN data both diverse and world-consistent remains problematic. To cope with this issue, we propose the world-consistent data generation (WCGEN), an efficacious data-augmentation framework satisfying both diversity and world-consistency, aimed at enhancing the generalization of agents to novel environments. Roughly, our framework consists of two stages, the trajectory stage which leverages a point-cloud based technique to ensure spatial coherency among viewpoints, and the viewpoint stage which adopts a novel angle synthesis method to guarantee spatial and wraparound consistency within the entire observation. By accurately predicting viewpoint changes with 3D knowledge, our approach maintains the world-consistency during the generation procedure. Experiments on a wide range of datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that our data augmentation strategy enables agents to achieve new state-of-the-art results on all navigation tasks, and is capable of enhancing the VLN agents' generalization ability to unseen environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The initial step in this process involves detecting Protected Health Information (PHI), which can be found in image metadata or imprinted within image pixels. Despite the importance of such systems, there has been limited evaluation of existing AI-based solutions, creating barriers to the development of reliable and robust tools. In this study, we present an AI-based pipeline for PHI detection, comprising three key modules: text detection, text extraction, and text analysis. We benchmark three models - YOLOv11, EasyOCR, and GPT-4o - across different setups corresponding to these modules, evaluating their performance on two different datasets encompassing multiple imaging modalities and PHI categories. Our findings indicate that the optimal setup involves utilizing dedicated vision and language models for each module, which achieves a commendable balance in performance, latency, and cost associated with the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we show that the application of LLMs not only involves identifying PHI content but also enhances OCR tasks and facilitates an end-to-end PHI detection pipeline, showcasing promising outcomes through our analysis.</p></details> | In progress | None |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules.

In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision. SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery.

Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs. In this paper we introduce Learned Augmented Residual Layer (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using LAuReL can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves 60% of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding 0.003% more parameters, and matches it while adding 2.6 times fewer parameters. Similarly, when pre-training 1B and 4B parameter LLMs, LAuReL improves performance on a variety of challenging downstream evaluation tasks by 2.54% to 20.05%, while adding only 0.012% and 0.1% additional parameters, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (2025), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIDL 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

MTL typically accomplishes this goal by learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were trained on. In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the target task's distribution.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures | None |

The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at UAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Though existing document pre-trained models have achieved excellent performance on standard benchmarks for VrDU, the way they model and exploit the interactions between vision and language on documents has hindered them from better generalization ability and higher accuracy. In this work, we investigate the problem of vision-language joint representation learning for VrDU mainly from the perspective of supervisory signals. Specifically, a pre-training paradigm called Bi-VLDoc is proposed, in which a bidirectional vision-language supervision strategy and a vision-language hybrid-attention mechanism are devised to fully explore and utilize the interactions between these two modalities, to learn stronger cross-modal document representations with richer semantics. Benefiting from the learned informative cross-modal document representations, Bi-VLDoc significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used document understanding benchmarks, including Form Understanding (from 85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction (from 96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (from 96.08% to 97.12%).

Existing VLN-CE frameworks rely on a two-stage approach: a waypoint predictor to generate waypoints and a navigator to execute movements. However, current waypoint predictors struggle with spatial awareness, while navigators lack historical reasoning and backtracking capabilities, limiting adaptability. We propose a zero-shot VLN-CE framework integrating an enhanced waypoint predictor with a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based navigator.

The navigator incorporates history-aware reasoning and adaptive path planning with backtracking, improving robustness. Experiments on R2R-CE and MP3D benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot settings, demonstrating competitive results compared to fully supervised methods.

This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research.

However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML | None |

In recent years, cross-modal information fusion has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance retrieval robustness. By integrating complementary information from different spectral modalities, it becomes possible to achieve more stable person recognition and matching under complex real-world conditions. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task: Text-RGBT Person Retrieval, which incorporates cross-spectrum information fusion by combining the complementary cues from visible and thermal modalities for robust person retrieval in challenging environments. The key challenge of Text-RGBT person retrieval lies in aligning text with multi-modal visual features. However, the inherent heterogeneity between visible and thermal modalities may interfere with the alignment between vision and language. To handle this problem, we propose a Decoupled Cross-modal Alignment network (DCAlign), which sufficiently mines the relationships between modality-specific and modality-collaborative visual with the text, for Text-RGBT person retrieval. To promote the research and development of this field, we create a high-quality Text-RGBT person retrieval dataset, RGBT-PEDES. RGBT-PEDES contains 1,822 identities from different age groups and genders with 4,723 pairs of calibrated RGB and T images, and covers high-diverse scenes from both daytime and nighttime with a various of challenges such as occlusion, weak alignment and adverse lighting conditions. Additionally, we carefully annotate 7,987 fine-grained textual descriptions for all RGBT person image pairs. Extensive experiments on RGBT-PEDES demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-image person retrieval methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations, together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

Existing multimodal benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning, lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and self-correction.

The generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling capabilities in vision-language models.

Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.</p></details> |  | None |

Although prior work has explored many merging strategies, resolving interference without additional data for retraining or test-time computation remains challenging. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the task vectors of the linear layer constitute an approximate linear subspace for its corresponding input. Therefore, we can minimize interference under the guidance of task vectors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{WUDI-Merging} (\textbf{W}hoever started the interference sho\textbf{U}ld en\textbf{D} \textbf{I}t), a simple yet effective model merging method that eliminates interference without any additional data or rescaling coefficients. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate our method's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-free model merging scenarios (average 10.9\% improvement versus baseline methods) while even outperforming mainstream test-time adaptation approaches by 3.3\%, and only very few computing resources are required.

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  | None |

This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Laws for Uncertainty in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09648v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws, demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data" is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments.

These are then combined with instructions and processed by the language model to generate high-quality responses. Despite significant progress in enhancing the language component, challenges persist in optimally fusing visual encodings within the language model for task-specific adaptability. Recent research has focused on improving this fusion through modality adaptation modules but at the cost of significantly increased model complexity and training data needs. In this paper, we propose EMMA (Efficient Multi-Modal Adaptation), a lightweight cross-modality module designed to efficiently fuse visual and textual encodings, generating instruction-aware visual representations for the language model. Our key contributions include: (1) an efficient early fusion mechanism that integrates vision and language representations with minimal added parameters (less than 0.2% increase in model size), (2) an in-depth interpretability analysis that sheds light on the internal mechanisms of the proposed method; (3) comprehensive experiments that demonstrate notable improvements on both specialized and general benchmarks for MLLMs. Empirical results show that EMMA boosts performance across multiple tasks by up to 9.3% while significantly improving robustness against hallucinations.

| **[Efficient Medical Vision-Language Alignment Through Adapting Masked Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08990v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding.

While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1.

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> | None |

However, despite their significant success, these models still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline, showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Astra-Global, a multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation.

Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources.

While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> |  | None |

To operate within the computation and communication constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads $s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices $\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads, recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$ directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that \textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Evaluating the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and single-modality attacks from the recent literature.

However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Moreover, as indicated by many empirical studies, some components of transformer architectures may be redundant. To derive a fully interpretable transformer architecture with only necessary components, we contend that the goal of representation learning is to compress a set of noisy initial token representations towards a mixture of low-dimensional subspaces. To compress these noisy token representations, an associated denoising operation naturally takes the form of a multi-head (subspace) self-attention. By unrolling such iterative denoising operations into a deep network, we arrive at a highly compact architecture that consists of \textit{only} self-attention operators with skip connections at each layer. Moreover, we show that each layer performs highly efficient denoising: it improves the signal-to-noise ratio of token representations \textit{at a linear rate} with respect to the number of layers. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on vision and language tasks demonstrate that such a transformer achieves performance close to that of standard transformer architectures such as GPT-2 and CRATE.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) methods designed for general agents in unknown environments, our approach specifically targets the efficient inspection of known scenes, with widespread applications in fields such as medical, marine, and civil engineering. Leveraging VLMs, our method first extracts points of interest (POIs) from the text description, then identifies a set of waypoints from which POIs are both salient and align with the spatial constraints defined in the prompt. Next, we interact with the VLM to iteratively refine the trajectory, preserving the visibility and prominence of the POIs. Further, we solve a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the most efficient visitation order that satisfies the order constraint implied in the text description. Finally, we apply trajectory optimization to generate smooth, executable inspection paths for aerial and underwater vehicles. We have evaluated our method across a series of both handcrafted and real-world scanned environments.

| **[FedRPCA: Enhancing Federated LoRA Aggregation Using Robust PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01194v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LoRA has emerged as one of the most promising fine-tuning techniques, especially for federated learning (FL), since it significantly reduces communication and computation costs at resource-constrained clients. However, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for LoRA-based FL, and the conventional aggregation strategy based on FedAvg suffers from slow convergence and suboptimal accuracy. Motivated by recent advances in model merging, particularly Task Arithmetic, we explore the idea of aggregating client LoRA parameters using scaled averaging. We first observe that a naive application of Task Arithmetic is ineffective due to the high cosine similarity between client updates, indicating significant common knowledge in the updates across clients. To address this issue, we propose decomposing client LoRA updates via Robust Principal Component Analysis (Robust-PCA) into a common low-rank component and client-specific sparse components. Our proposed algorithm FedRPCA aggregates the low-rank components through averaging, consolidating common knowledge, and applies scaled averaging to the sparse components to amplify client-specific knowledge. We evaluate our approach across a variety of vision and language tasks and demonstrate that it achieves higher final accuracy and faster convergence compared to competing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Numerous algorithms exist to address specific settings, but choosing the right training algorithm for the right dataset without trial and error is difficult. Indeed, real-world applications often involve multiple types and combinations of shifts that are hard to analyze theoretically. Method. This work explores the possibility of learning the selection of a training algorithm for OOD generalization. We propose a proof of concept (OOD-Chameleon) that formulates the selection as a multi-label classification over candidate algorithms, trained on a dataset of datasets representing a variety of shifts. We evaluate the ability of OOD-Chameleon to rank algorithms on unseen shifts and datasets based only on dataset characteristics, i.e., without training models first, unlike traditional model selection. Findings. Extensive experiments show that the learned selector identifies high-performing algorithms across synthetic, vision, and language tasks. Further inspection shows that it learns non-trivial decision rules, which provide new insights into the applicability of existing algorithms. Overall, this new approach opens the possibility of better exploiting and understanding the plethora of existing algorithms for OOD generalization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 | None |

Despite recent interest in the problem, a significant performance gap between the combined and single-task models remains. In this paper, we investigate the key characteristics of task matrices -- weight update matrices applied to a pre-trained model -- that enable effective merging. We show that alignment between singular components of task-specific and merged matrices strongly correlates with performance improvement over the pre-trained model. Based on this, we propose an isotropic merging framework that flattens the singular value spectrum of task matrices, enhances alignment, and reduces the performance gap. Additionally, we incorporate both common and task-specific subspaces to further improve alignment and performance. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language tasks across various sets of tasks and model scales. This work advances the understanding of model merging dynamics, offering an effective methodology to merge models without requiring additional training.

These large architectures serve as the baseline to what is currently known as Instruction Tuning Large Vision and Language models (IT-LVLMs). IT-LVLMs are general-purpose multi-modal assistants whose responses are modulated by natural language instructions and visual data. Despite this versatility, IT-LVLM effectiveness in fundamental computer vision problems remains unclear, primarily due to the absence of a standardized evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces a Multi-modal Evaluation Benchmark named MERLIM, a scalable test-bed to assess the capabilities of IT-LVLMs on fundamental computer vision tasks. MERLIM contains over 300K image-question pairs and has a strong focus on detecting cross-modal "hallucination" events in IT-LVLMs. Our results bring important insights on the performance of state-of-the-art IT-LVLMs including limitations at identifying fine-grained visual concepts, object hallucinations across tasks, and biases towards the language query. Our findings also suggest that these models have weak visual grounding, but manage to make adequate guesses from global visual patterns or language biases contained in the LLM component. We name this phenomenon of correct answers with no visual grounding as hidden hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between $\varphi$ and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of $\varphi$.We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results.xtensive experimental results show that UBA \textit{consistently surpasses} the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich, human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced, and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in real-world geospatial workflows.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler) |

Existing methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, struggle when adapted to VLP models due to their restricted optimization spaces, leading to ineffective attacks or unnatural artifacts. To address this, we propose \textbf{LightD}, a novel framework that generates natural adversarial samples for VLP models via semantically guided relighting. Specifically, LightD leverages ChatGPT to propose context-aware initial lighting parameters and integrates a pretrained relighting model (IC-light) to enable diverse lighting adjustments. LightD expands the optimization space while ensuring perturbations align with scene semantics. Additionally, gradient-based optimization is applied to the reference lighting image to further enhance attack effectiveness while maintaining visual naturalness. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed LightD have been demonstrated across various VLP models in tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding.

Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark.

While foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service (QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects. Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in physical-world deployments.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities, resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA models by learning unified representations for primitives from different modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG) |

However, the application of prompt learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning (VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{} and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we discover that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. To address this issue, we rebalance the computational load from data, model, and memory perspectives, achieving more balanced computation across devices. Specifically, for the data, instances are grouped into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. A search-based method is employed for the model to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjust the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. These three perspectives are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, training time is reduced greatly, achieving about 1.8$\times$ speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability are further validated across various models and datasets.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this challenge by utilizing unlabeled data alongside limited labeled examples, while the emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers powerful zero-shot capabilities that can further reduce labeling cost. However, directly fine-tuning large FMs is often impractical in resource-constrained settings, and na\"ively using their pseudo-labels for unlabeled data can degrade performance due to its unreliablity or domain mismatch with target task. In this work, we introduce ZeroMatch, a novel SSL framework that integrates knowledge distillation with consistency-based learning to jointly leverage labeled data, unlabeled data, and pseudo-labels from FMs. ZeroMatch enables training compact student models using only FM inference, making it suitable for low-resource environments such as personal devices with limited compute. Experiments on six vision and language classification benchmarks show that ZeroMatch consistently outperforms standard SSL and zero-shot augmented methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across a range of foundation model qualities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for Neurips 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Large Learning Rates under Standard Width Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities (vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scalings for standard initialization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, multiple approaches employing pre-trained large language and vision models have been proposed for this task. However, they are computationally demanding and require careful fine-tuning of the produced outputs. A more lightweight alternative would be the implementation of multimodal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which can extract the latent features of the data and integrate them into a joint representation, as has been demonstrated mostly on image-image or image-text data for the state-of-the-art models. Here we explore whether and how can multimodal VAEs be employed in unsupervised robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Based on the obtained results, we propose a model-invariant training alternative that improves the models' performance in a simulator by up to 55%. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the challenges raised by the individual tasks such as object or robot position variability, number of distractors or the task length. Our work thus also sheds light on the potential benefits and limitations of using the current multimodal VAEs for unsupervised learning of robotic motion trajectories based on vision and language.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> | None |

We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While Large Language models (LLMs) and VLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in text and image understanding, their performance on complex, real world multimodal table reasoning remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMTBENCH (Multimodal Table Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 500 real world multimodal tables drawn from diverse real world sources, with a total of 4021 question answer pairs. MMTBENCH questions cover four question types (Explicit, Implicit, Answer Mention, and Visual Based), five reasoning types (Mathematical, Extrema Identification, Fact Verification, Vision Based, and Others), and eight table types (Single/Multiple Entity, Maps and Charts with Entities, Single/Multiple Charts, Maps, and Visualizations). Extensive evaluation of state of the art models on all types reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on questions requiring visual-based reasoning and multi-step inference. These findings show the urgent need for improved architectures that more tightly integrate vision and language processing. By providing a challenging, high-quality resource that mirrors the complexity of real-world tasks, MMTBENCH underscores its value as a resource for future research on multimodal tables.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transparent and Coherent Procedural Mistake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11927v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that while VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods- though not without tradeoff. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle with this difficulty, we introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process.

In this paper, we hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse, fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition in bias mitigation and suggest it as a alternative lever for improving the robustness and fairness of machine learning models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross from Left to Right Brain: Adaptive Text Dreamer for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20897v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.

However, the existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework, consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms, incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs. 149), and fewer GPU resources (4 V100 vs. 16 A100), achieves even higher performance (+1.0% in APr).

A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are 14 pages, 8 figures</p></details> | None |

Explore Function-preserving Attention Replacement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21535v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformers excel across vision and language pretraining tasks, their reliance on attention mechanisms poses challenges for inference efficiency, especially on edge and embedded accelerators with limited parallelism and memory bandwidth. Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the transformer's attention module.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages main paper + 6 pages appendix, 14 figures; submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by large vision and language models (VLM) have demonstrated significant potential in completing daily computer tasks, such as browsing the web to book travel and operating desktop software, which requires agents to understand these interfaces. Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing their tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques, such as asking the agent to ignore pop-ups or including an advertisement notice, are ineffective against the attack.</p></details> | ACL 2025 | None |

In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1) transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training, even when replacing every attention layer of the transformer, and (2) hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences $(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$ for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of contexts.

As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72 times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for representative vision and language models training tasks under bandwidth-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Current materials science evaluation datasets such as MaScQA and SciQA remain largely text-based and fail to capture the visual and research-level analytic complexity required in materials discovery and design. We introduce MatVQA, a scalable benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. Generated via an automated pipeline, MArxivAgent, from recent materials literature, MatVQA features 1325 questions across four critical structure-property-performance (SPP) reasoning tasks. Uniquely, MatVQA employs an iterative process to eliminate textual shortcuts, compelling MLLMs to perform fine-grained, low-level visual analysis of material imagery (e.g., microscopy, diffraction patterns) integrated with multi-step scientific reasoning. Benchmarking 17 open- and closed-source MLLMs on MatVQA reveals substantial gaps in current multimodal reasoning capabilities. MatVQA benchmark data, along with evaluation code, is publicly available in \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/matvqa-1E01}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/matvqa-1E01/README.md} to catalyze further research in applying MLLMs to complex materials science problems.</p></details> |  | None |

Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their effectiveness often comes at the cost of substantial computational overhead. To address this issue, state-of-the-art methods aim to replicate ensemble-class performance without requiring multiple independently trained networks. Unfortunately, these algorithms often still demand considerable compute at inference. In response to these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{NeuroTrails}$, a sparse multi-head architecture with dynamically evolving topology. This unexplored model-agnostic training paradigm improves ensemble performance while reducing the required resources. We analyze the underlying reason for its effectiveness and observe that the various neural trails induced by dynamic sparsity attain a $\textit{Goldilocks zone}$ of prediction diversity. NeuroTrails displays efficacy with convolutional and transformer-based architectures on computer vision and language tasks.

Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.</p></details> |  | None |

Tracking the Evolution of Reasoning Performance in GPT-[n] and o-[n] Models on Multimodal Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01081v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The releases of OpenAI's o-[n] series, such as o1, o3, and o4-mini, mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, models like o3 have demonstrated strong performance on benchmarks like the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models (including o1, o3, and o4-mini) on challenging multimodal puzzles from PuzzleVQA and AlgoPuzzleVQA, which demand fine-grained visual perception. Our results reveal that o-[n] series, particularly later iterations like o3 and o4-mini, significantly outperform the GPT-[n] series and show strong scalability in multimodal reasoning. Nonetheless, despite these substantial advancements and the superior capabilities demonstrated by the o-[n] series, our findings highlight that even these leading models face persistent challenges. Difficulties are particularly evident in tasks requiring precise visual perception, robust compositional reasoning across multiple visual attributes, and solving complex algorithmic or highly combinatorial puzzles, indicating critical areas for future AGI development. We plan to continuously track new models in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly.

However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that, as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines, indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts.

The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in unseen environments.

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and trigger undesired outputs. In embodied scenarios, such vulnerabilities pose greater risks: unlike plain text models that generate toxic content, embodied agents may interpret malicious instructions as executable commands, potentially leading to real-world harm. In this paper, we present the first systematic jailbreak attack paradigm targeting MLLM-driven navigator. We propose a three-tiered attack framework and construct malicious queries across four intent categories, concatenated with standard navigation instructions. In the Matterport3D simulator, we evaluate navigation agents powered by five MLLMs and report an average attack success rate over 90%. To test real-world feasibility, we replicate the attack on a physical robot. Our results show that even well-crafted prompts can induce harmful actions and intents in MLLMs, posing risks beyond toxic output and potentially leading to physical harm.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

Moreover, FlashAttention with IO-aware speedup resolves the efficiency issue of standard attention, further promoting its practicality. Beyond canonical attention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position bias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold. In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent, which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations, we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the effectiveness of practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we reformulate model merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding new models requires no extra memory.

Unlike the majority of existing unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms, which are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made during the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the training phase, adopting a "forward-looking" perspective. Building upon well-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains machine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well prepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and principled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any gradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on both vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including class-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show that by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn produces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages when future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved retention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the inadvertent recovery of forgotten data. We hope this work could inspire future efforts to explore more proactive strategies for equipping machine learning models with built-in readiness towards more reliable and principled machine unlearning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://milanganai.github.io/fortress/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://milanganai.github.io/fortress) |

Most existing approaches have adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling, dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and (2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Grand claims, such as models achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions. At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and the claims being made.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: olawale@mit.edu</p></details> | None |

These difficulties are further magnified in the multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning, and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling. First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality, diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance. Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason' schema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action to take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face challenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate observation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present VISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation strategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local observations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment Filter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current observations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for action selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results on Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success Rate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating forward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for robust navigation in long-horizon environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, CoRL 2025</p></details> | None |

Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation.

Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.17002</p></details> | None |

Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

The agent must accurately locate the target based on visual information from the environment and complete tasks through interaction with the surroundings. Despite significant advancements in this field, two major limitations persist: (1) Many existing methods input complete language instructions directly into multi-layer Transformer networks without fully exploiting the detailed information within the instructions, thereby limiting the agent's language understanding capabilities during task execution; (2) Current approaches often overlook the modeling of object relationships across different modalities, failing to effectively utilize latent clues between objects, which affects the accuracy and robustness of navigation decisions. We propose a Dual Object Perception-Enhancement Network (DOPE) to address these issues to improve navigation performance. First, we design a Text Semantic Extraction (TSE) to extract relatively essential phrases from the text and input them into the Text Object Perception-Augmentation (TOPA) to fully leverage details such as objects and actions within the instructions. Second, we introduce an Image Object Perception-Augmentation (IOPA), which performs additional modeling of object information across different modalities, enabling the model to more effectively utilize latent clues between objects in images and text, enhancing decision-making accuracy.

There are multiple fair FL algorithms in the literature, which have been relatively successful in providing fairness. However, these algorithms mostly emphasize on the loss functions of worst-off clients to improve their performance, which often results in the suppression of well-performing ones. As a consequence, they usually sacrifice the system's overall average performance for achieving fairness. Motivated by this and inspired by two well-known risk modeling methods in Finance, Mean-Variance and Mean-Semi-Variance, we propose and study two new fair FL algorithms, Variance Reduction (VRed) and Semi-Variance Reduction (SemiVRed). VRed encourages equality between clients' loss functions by penalizing their variance. In contrast, SemiVRed penalizes the discrepancy of only the worst-off clients' loss functions from the average loss. Through extensive experiments on multiple vision and language datasets, we show that, SemiVRed achieves SoTA performance in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and improves both fairness and system overall average performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior methods often rely on either global scene representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios.

Consequently, investment in data collection for robotics has grown across both industrial and academic labs. However, despite the marked increase in the quantity of demonstrations collected, little work has sought to assess the quality of said data despite mounting evidence of its importance in other areas such as vision and language. In this work, we take a critical step towards addressing the data quality in robotics. Given a dataset of demonstrations, we aim to estimate the relative quality of individual demonstrations in terms of both action diversity and predictability. To do so, we estimate the average contribution of a trajectory towards the mutual information between states and actions in the entire dataset, which captures both the entropy of the marginal action distribution and the state-conditioned action entropy. Though commonly used mutual information estimators require vast amounts of data often beyond the scale available in robotics, we introduce a novel technique based on k-nearest neighbor estimates of mutual information on top of simple VAE embeddings of states and actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is able to partition demonstration datasets by quality according to human expert scores across a diverse set of benchmarks spanning simulation and real world environments. Moreover, training policies based on data filtered by our method leads to a 5-10% improvement in RoboMimic and better performance on real ALOHA and Franka setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and code at https://jhejna.github.io/demonstration-info.

MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be pubilshed in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Assessing and Learning Alignment of Unimodal Vision and Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04616v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How well are unimodal vision and language models aligned? Although prior work have approached answering this question, their assessment methods do not directly translate to how these models are used in practical vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose a direct assessment method, inspired by linear probing, to assess vision-language alignment. We identify that the degree of alignment of the SSL vision models depends on their SSL training objective, and we find that the clustering quality of SSL representations has a stronger impact on alignment performance than their linear separability. Next, we introduce Swift Alignment of Image and Language (SAIL), a efficient transfer learning framework that aligns pretrained unimodal vision and language models for downstream vision-language tasks. Since SAIL leverages the strengths of pretrained unimodal models, it requires significantly fewer (6%) paired image-text data for the multimodal alignment compared to models like CLIP which are trained from scratch. SAIL training only requires a single A100 GPU, 5 hours of training and can accommodate a batch size up to 32,768. SAIL achieves 73.4% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet (vs. CLIP's 72.7%) and excels in zero-shot retrieval, complex reasoning, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, SAIL improves the language-compatibility of vision encoders that in turn enhance the performance of multimodal large language models.

To address these limitations, we introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, and sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that provides non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution. Moreover, we show that mild smoothing enables a graceful tradeoff between accuracy and stability, in contrast to prior certification methods that require a more aggressive compromise. Using Boolean function analysis, we give a novel characterization of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of explanation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction.

However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97\% accuracy at genus and 94\% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50\% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

| **[Vision and Language Integration for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12966v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps, it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic representation of the relations between categories through word vector distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a general-purpose fusion framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for any unimodal encoder that enforces shape consistency between modality representations. It harmonises these representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, surpasses all benchmarks in five out of seven datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Spectral Graph Transformers Meet Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Non-IID Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11808v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly advancing due to GNNs' capacity to learn distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing large volumes of real-world graph data for GNN training is often impractical due to privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, offers a solution by preserving data privacy with collaborative model training. Despite progress in training huge vision and language models, federated learning for GNNs remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for federated learning on GNNs based on spectral GNNs equipped with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) for better information capture, showing promising results across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our approach effectively handles non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, while also achieving performance comparable to existing methods that only operate on IID data. It is designed to be privacy-preserving and bandwidth-optimized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, which often involve complex, non-IID, and heterophilic graph structures. Our results in the area of federated learning on non-IID heterophilic graphs demonstrate significant improvements, while also achieving better performance on homophilic graphs. This work highlights the potential of federated learning in diverse and challenging graph settings.

Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves as a valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with significant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and finance.

However, they face challenges in integrating multimodal inputs commonly used in robotics like vision and language into their framework. To fully maximize DMPs' potential, enabling them to handle multimodal inputs is essential. In addition, we also aim to extend DMPs' capability to handle object-focused tasks requiring one-shot complex motion generation, as observation occlusion could easily happen mid-execution in such tasks (e.g., knife occlusion in cake icing, hand occlusion in dough kneading, etc.). A promising approach is to leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which process multimodal data and can grasp high-level concepts. However, they typically lack enough knowledge and capabilities to directly infer low-level motion details and instead only serve as a bridge between high-level instructions and low-level control. To address this limitation, we propose Keyword Labeled Primitive Selection and Keypoint Pairs Generation Guided Movement Primitives (KeyMPs), a framework that combines VLMs with sequencing of DMPs. KeyMPs use VLMs' high-level reasoning capability to select a reference primitive through keyword labeled primitive selection and VLMs' spatial awareness to generate spatial scaling parameters used for sequencing DMPs by generalizing the overall motion through keypoint pairs generation, which together enable one-shot vision-language guided motion generation that aligns with the intent expressed in the multimodal input. We validate our approach through an occlusion-rich manipulation task, specifically object cutting experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating superior performance over other DMP-based methods that integrate VLMs support.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Submitted to IEEE Access April 9th 2025</p></details> | None |

Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[See or Recall: A Sanity Check for the Role of Vision in Solving Visualization Question Answer Tasks with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09809v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly. This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks. Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy). However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem. During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided. We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal. It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge). This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering. Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets.

In spite of the preliminary empirical success of sketched adaptive methods, existing convergence analyses show the communication cost to have a linear dependence on the ambient dimension, i.e., number of parameters, which is prohibitively high for modern deep learning models. In this work, we introduce specific sketched adaptive federated learning (SAFL) algorithms and, as our main contribution, provide theoretical convergence analyses in different FL settings with guarantees on communication cost depending only logarithmically (instead of linearly) on the ambient dimension. Unlike existing analyses, we show that the entry-wise sketching noise existent in the preconditioners and the first moments of SAFL can be implicitly addressed by leveraging the recently-popularized anisotropic curvatures in deep learning losses, e.g., fast decaying loss Hessian eigen-values. In the i.i.d. client setting of FL, we show that SAFL achieves asymptotic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence, and converges faster in the initial epochs. In the non-i.i.d. client setting, where non-adaptive methods lack convergence guarantees, we show that SACFL (SAFL with clipping) algorithms can provably converge in spite of the additional heavy-tailed noise. Our theoretical claims are supported by empirical studies on vision and language tasks, and in both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Surprisingly, as a by-product of our analysis, the proposed SAFL methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art communication-efficient federated learning algorithms based on error feedback.</p></details> |  | None |

We address this gap by training SAEs on CLIP's vision transformer and uncover key differences between vision and language processing, including distinct sparsity patterns for SAEs trained across layers and token types. We then provide the first systematic analysis on the steerability of CLIP's vision transformer by introducing metrics to quantify how precisely SAE features can be steered to affect the model's output. We find that 10-15\% of neurons and features are steerable, with SAEs providing thousands more steerable features than the base model. Through targeted suppression of SAE features, we then demonstrate improved performance on three vision disentanglement tasks (CelebA, Waterbirds, and typographic attacks), finding optimal disentanglement in middle model layers, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on defense against typographic attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

However, they still fall short in zero-shot reasoning tasks that require multi-step inferencing. To achieve this goal, previous works resort to a divide-and-conquer pipeline. In this paper, we argue that previous efforts have several inherent shortcomings: 1) They rely on domain-specific sub-question decomposing models. 2) They force models to predict the final answer even if the sub-questions or sub-answers provide insufficient information. We address these limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL reasoning using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, IdealGPT utilizes an LLM to generate sub-questions, a VLM to provide corresponding sub-answers, and another LLM to reason to achieve the final answer. These three modules perform the divide-and-conquer procedure iteratively until the model is confident about the final answer to the main question. We evaluate IdealGPT on multiple challenging VL reasoning tasks under a zero-shot setting. In particular, our IdealGPT outperforms the best existing GPT-4-like models by an absolute 10% on VCR and 15% on SNLI-VE.

Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation.

Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report consisting of 16 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[EE-MLLM: A Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11795v3)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated satisfactory performance across various vision-language tasks. Current approaches for vision and language interaction fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. However, both approaches present inherent limitations, forcing a trade-off between data and computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Data-$\textbf{E}$fficient and Compute-$\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{MLLM}$ ($\textbf{EE-MLLM}$). Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention among visual tokens to achieve $\textbf{compute efficiency}$, and 2) reusing the weights from each layer of LLM to facilitate effective vision-language modality alignment for $\textbf{data efficiency}$. As a result, EE-MLLM significantly outperforms Flamingo with limited training data, and reduces the prefilling time to 79 ms on an H800 GPU, compared to LLaVA's 277 ms. To further investigate the efficiency of EE-MLLM, we present a training-free variant named EE-MLLM-F, which reduces the computation cost of self-attention-based method without additional training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, while their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early to reduce the likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and model-centric approaches. We also emphasise deeper integration across multiple levels of multimodality and multidisciplinary collaboration to significantly broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response, self-driving car design, and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability, and finance. By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal impact.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-guided Representation Learning for Multi-Label Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03801v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[VLIPP: Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation with Vision and Language Informed Physical Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23368v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics with vision and language informed physical prior. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods. More video results are available on our Project Page: https://madaoer.github.io/projects/physically_plausible_video_generation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures | [Code Link](https://madaoer.github.io/projects) |
| **[Efficient Alignment of Unconditioned Action Prior for Language-conditioned Pick and Place in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09423v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.

However, challenges remain in integrating speech, text, and vision into a unified model, especially for spoken tasks. Speech generation methods vary (some produce speech directly), others through text (but their impact on quality is unclear). Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

Towards Vision-Language Correspondence without Parallel Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24129v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In particular, pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This suggests that as foundation models mature, it may become possible to match vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without parallel data. We present the first feasibility study, and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised, or "blind", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy without any image-text annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, Project page: https://dominik-schnaus.github.io/itsamatch/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://dominik-schnaus.github.io/itsamatch) |
| **[COSMO: Combination of Selective Memorization for Low-cost Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24065v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have gained prominence within artificial intelligence research due to their potential application in fields like home assistants. Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on transformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components such as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance. These additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and increased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance and low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the COmbination of Selective MemOrization (COSMO). Specifically, COSMO integrates state-space modules and transformer modules, and incorporates two VLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS) and the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates comprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3 module adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture, thereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental validations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not only demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show a significant reduction in computational costs.</p></details> |  | None |

By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional SFDA methods are limited by the information encoded in the pre-trained source model and the unlabeled target data. Recently, approaches leveraging auxiliary resources have emerged, yet remain in their early stages, offering ample opportunities for research. In this work, we propose a novel method that incorporates auxiliary information by extending an existing SFDA framework using Vision-and-Language (ViL) models. Specifically, we build upon Attracting and Dispersing (AaD), a widely adopted SFDA technique, and generalize its core principle to naturally integrate ViL models as a powerful initialization for target adaptation. Our approach, called ViL-enhanced AaD (ViLAaD), preserves the simplicity and flexibility of the AaD framework, while leveraging ViL models to significantly boost adaptation performance. We validate our method through experiments using various ViL models, demonstrating that ViLAaD consistently outperforms both AaD and zero-shot classification by ViL models, especially when both the source model and ViL model provide strong initializations. Moreover, the flexibility of ViLAaD allows it to be seamlessly incorporated into an alternating optimization framework with ViL prompt tuning and extended with additional objectives for target model adaptation. Extensive experiments on four SFDA benchmarks show that this enhanced version, ViLAaD++, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SFDA scenarios, including Closed-set SFDA, Partial-set SFDA, and Open-set SFDA.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |
| **[Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) implicitly learn to associate image regions with words from large-scale training data, demonstrating an emergent capability for grounding concepts without dense annotations[14,18,51]. However, the coarse-grained supervision from image-caption pairs is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities in object-concept correspondence, even with enormous data volume. Rich semantic and syntactic structures within the text modality have been overlooked as sources of supervision. Starting from contrastive architectures (BLIP and ALBEF) that show strong intrinsic grounding abilities, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST). HIST enhances spatial vision-language alignment without using additional human annotations, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subjects, Phrases, and Composite Phrases, and enforcing entailment relation between a parent and its children in the hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of the corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Composition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed. Compared to baseline VLMs, HIST achieves up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding and +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation. Surprisingly, the improved spatial grounding leads to improvements in other downstream VLM tasks: +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vocabulary-Free 3D Instance Segmentation with Vision and Language Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10652v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most recent 3D instance segmentation methods are open vocabulary, offering a greater flexibility than closed-vocabulary methods. Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering "List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.

However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The "X" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g., SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops. These advancements broaden the scope of agentic AI applications by providing a foundation for scalable, contextually and spatiotemporally aware systems capable of immersive dynamic 4D scene interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework for thoroughly assessing their cross-modality perception performance. We introduce MAVERIX~(Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods rely on manually annotated surgical videos to predict a fixed set of object categories, limiting their generalizability to unseen surgical procedures and downstream tasks. In this work, we put forward the idea that the surgical video lectures available through open surgical e-learning platforms can provide effective vision and language supervisory signals for multi-modal representation learning without relying on manual annotations. We address the surgery-specific linguistic challenges present in surgical video lectures by employing multiple complementary automatic speech recognition systems to generate text transcriptions. We then present a novel method, SurgVLP - Surgical Vision Language Pre-training, for multi-modal representation learning. Extensive experiments across diverse surgical procedures and tasks demonstrate that the multi-modal representations learned by SurgVLP exhibit strong transferability and adaptability in surgical video analysis. Furthermore, our zero-shot evaluations highlight SurgVLP's potential as a general-purpose foundation model for surgical workflow analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotations for downstream tasks, and facilitating adaptation methods such as few-shot learning to build a scalable and data-efficient solution for various downstream surgical applications.

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks.

Traditionally, this task has been approached as a sequence generation problem, relying on vision-and-language techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant reports. However, in this paper, we propose a novel perspective: rethinking medical report generation as a multi-label classification problem. By framing the task this way, we leverage the radiology nodes from the commonly used knowledge graph, which can be better captured through classification techniques. To verify our argument, we introduce a novel report generation framework based on BLIP integrated with classified key nodes, which allows for effective report generation with accurate classification of multiple key aspects within the medical images. This approach not only simplifies the report generation process but also significantly enhances performance metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging key nodes can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, surpassing existing approaches across two benchmark datasets. The results underscore the potential of re-envisioning traditional tasks with innovative methodologies, paving the way for more efficient and accurate medical report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Medical Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
