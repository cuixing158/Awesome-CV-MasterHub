| **[Augmenting learning in neuro-embodied systems through neurobiological first principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04525v5)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from physics and neuroscience, particularly through the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and language processing. Despite these advances, they struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency -- capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks often overlook two key biophysical properties of neural circuits: neuronal diversity and cell-specific neuromodulation. These mechanisms, essential for regulating dynamic learning across brain scales, allow neuromodulators to introduce degeneracy in biological neural networks, ensuring stability and adaptability under changing conditions. In this article, we summarize recent bioinspired models, learning rules, and architectures, and propose a framework for augmenting ANNs, which has the potential to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI through neurobiological first principles. Our proposed dual-framework approach leverages spiking neural networks to emulate diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartmental dynamics, thereby simulating the morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how integrating these biophysical principles into task-driven spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems provides scalable solutions for continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency. Additionally, this approach will not only provide insights into how emergent behaviors arise in neural networks but also catalyze the development of more efficient, reliable, and intelligent neuromorphic systems and robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 3 boxes, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[AlignVLM: Bridging Vision and Language Latent Spaces for Multimodal Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01341v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning visual features with language embeddings is a key challenge in vision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), lack inductive bias to constrain visual features within the linguistic structure of the LLM's embedding space, making them data-hungry and prone to cross-modal misalignment. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where visual and textual modalities are highly correlated. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods, with larger gains on document understanding tasks and under low-resource setups. We provide further analysis demonstrating its efficiency and robustness to noise.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15049v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents typically assumes a \textit{train-once-deploy-once} strategy, which is unrealistic as deployed agents continually encounter novel environments. To address this, we propose the Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, where agents learn and adapt incrementally across multiple \textit{scene domains}. CVLN includes two setups: Initial-instruction based CVLN for instruction-following, and Dialogue-based CVLN for dialogue-guided navigation. We also introduce two simple yet effective baselines for sequential decision-making: Perplexity Replay (PerpR), which replays difficult episodes, and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR), which stores and revisits action logits during training. Experiments show that existing continual learning methods fall short for CVLN, while PerpR and ESR achieve better performance by efficiently utilizing replay memory.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://emu.world</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5) |
| **[Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning Using Vision-Language Alignment in Zero-Shot Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26580v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings. This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios. The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors. Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Dynamic Traceback Learning for Medical Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13267v4)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> | None |
| **[MoralCLIP: Contrastive Alignment of Vision-and-Language Representations with Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05696v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version: corresponds to the ACM MM '25 published paper and includes full appendix material</p></details> | None |
| **[Instance-Level Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25387v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives. To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition.

| **[NanoVLA: Routing Decoupled Vision-Language Understanding for Nano-sized Generalist Robotic Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25122v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action (NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1) vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models, with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RETTA: Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07046v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant progress of fully-supervised video captioning, zero-shot methods remain much less explored. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning framework named Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (RETTA), which takes advantage of existing pretrained large-scale vision and language models to directly generate captions with test-time adaptation. Specifically, we bridge video and text using four key models: a general video-text retrieval model XCLIP, a general image-text matching model CLIP, a text alignment model AnglE, and a text generation model GPT-2, due to their source-code availability. The main challenge is how to enable the text generation model to be sufficiently aware of the content in a given video so as to generate corresponding captions. To address this problem, we propose using learnable tokens as a communication medium among these four frozen models GPT-2, XCLIP, CLIP, and AnglE. Different from the conventional way that trains these tokens with training data, we propose to learn these tokens with soft targets of the inference data under several carefully crafted loss functions, which enable the tokens to absorb video information catered for GPT-2. This procedure can be efficiently done in just a few iterations (we use 16 iterations in the experiments) and does not require ground truth data. Extensive experimental results on three widely used datasets, MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX, show absolute 5.1%-32.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr compared to several state-of-the-art zero-shot video captioning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> | None |
| **[Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapting Interleaved Encoders with PPO for Language-Guided Reinforcement Learning in BabyAI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23148v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer. This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Undergraduate research project, IIT Palakkad, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Rethinking the Text-Vision Reasoning Imbalance in MLLMs through the Lens of Training Recipes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22836v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities. Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the \textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning.

| **[VideoHallu: Evaluating and Mitigating Multi-modal Hallucinations on Synthetic Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01481v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong results in video understanding, yet a key question remains: do they truly comprehend visual content or only learn shallow correlations between vision and language? Real visual understanding, especially of physics and common sense, is essential for AI systems that interact with the physical world. Current evaluations mostly use real-world videos similar to training data, so high benchmark scores may not reflect real reasoning ability. To address this, we propose negative-control tests using videos that depict physically impossible or logically inconsistent events. We introduce VideoHallu, a synthetic dataset of physics- and commonsense-violating scenes generated with Veo2, Sora, and Kling. It includes expert-annotated question-answer pairs across four categories of violations. Tests of leading VLMs (Qwen-2.5-VL, Video-R1, VideoChat-R1) show that, despite strong results on benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU, they often miss these violations, exposing gaps in visual reasoning. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on VideoHallu improves recognition of such violations without reducing standard benchmark performance.

In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1) transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training, even when replacing every attention layer of the Transformer, and (2) hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences $(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$ for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of contexts.

| **[VL-SAE: Interpreting and Enhancing Vision-Language Alignment with a Unified Concept Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21323v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

| **[A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20542v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL, which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens. We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations, which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fake-in-Facext: Towards Fine-Grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20531v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context (Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation. Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks, FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA performance on existing XDFA datasets.

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, these pretrained models require additional training stages to become effective for downstream applications. In the multi-task setting, prior works have shown empirically that specific meta-learning approaches for preparing a model for future adaptation through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can outperform standard retraining methods, but the mechanism of the benefits of meta-learning has been largely unexplored. We introduce a framework for generic PEFT-based meta-learning to learn a model that can easily adapt to unseen tasks. For linear models using LoRA, we show that standard retraining is provably suboptimal for finding an adaptable set of parameters and provide strict performance guarantees for our proposed method. We verify these theoretical insights through experiments on synthetic data as well as real-data vision and language tasks. We observe significant performance benefits using a simple implementation of our proposed meta-learning scheme during retraining relative to the conventional approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods face a critical trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control. LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FairNet: Dynamic Fairness Correction without Performance Loss via Contrastive Conditional LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19421v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge. Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of FairNet.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work, we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability. We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods. Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlashBias: Fast Computation of Attention with Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12044v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention with bias, which extends standard attention by introducing prior knowledge as an additive bias matrix to the query-key scores, has been widely deployed in vision, language, protein-folding and other advanced scientific models, underscoring its status as a key evolution of this foundational module. However, introducing bias terms creates a severe efficiency bottleneck in attention computation. It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalizations. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for Pairformer in AlphaFold 3, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://github.com/HiThink-Research/NEXUS-O</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HiThink-Research/NEXUS-O) |
| **[Computational Budget Should Be Considered in Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16806v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem: the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most approaches treat these regions in isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure. Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned results.

Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns - derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484 tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models, emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://passing2961.github.io/multiverse-project-page/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://passing2961.github.io/multiverse-project-page) |

Existing methods often make decisions based on historical information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization.

However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on both vision and language benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (main + supp)</p></details> | None |

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-) How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like `bouba' with round shapes and `kiki' with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as a measure of model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel approach to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these model variants do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both model variants lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, their reliance on labeled image datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR and NeurIPS 2025 UniReps</p></details> | None |

Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts. To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets, curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle multi-modal visual reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there is little work that explores the structure of the language space in this context. We propose GTA-CLIP, a novel technique that incorporates supervision from language models for joint transduction in language and vision spaces. Our approach is iterative and consists of three steps: (i) incrementally exploring the attribute space by querying language models, (ii) an attribute-augmented transductive inference procedure, and (iii) fine-tuning the language and vision encoders based on inferred labels within the dataset. Through experiments with CLIP encoders, we demonstrate that GTA-CLIP, yields an average performance improvement of 8.6% and 3.7% across 12 datasets and 3 encoders, over CLIP and transductive CLIP respectively in the zero-shot setting. We also observe similar improvements in a few-shot setting.

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready Version (oral)</p></details> | None |

It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation, helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that disentangles a time series into content and style representations via convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings | None |

Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we discover that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. To address this issue, we rebalance the computational load from data, model, and memory perspectives, achieving more balanced computation across devices. Specifically, for the data, instances are grouped into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. A search-based method is employed for the model to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjust the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. These three perspectives are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, training time is reduced greatly, achieving about 1.8$\times$ speed-up.

SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge, whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed system consists of a modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification. Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues, enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion, and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing data selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity. We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set, drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection. In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules.

| **[BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08572v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language, robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments. Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on the project page.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Dream to Recall: Imagination-Guided Experience Retrieval for Memory-Persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08553v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters.

This study examines automated text box placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method, a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM (Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images. Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in automated layout design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transparent and Coherent Procedural Mistake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11927v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the RLinf Team, focusing on the algorithm side.

| **[Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06131v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.</p></details> | 16 pages,6 figures | None |
| **[REAR: Rethinking Visual Autoregressive Models via Generator-Tokenizer Consistency Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04450v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models. Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet, it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision. SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery.

Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Nghie...</summary><p>Nghiem T.

While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area, we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub, enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Building on existing evaluations of overall classification robustness, this work aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CLIP by introducing several new perspectives. First, we investigate their robustness to variations in specific visual factors. Second, we assess two critical safety objectives--confidence uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection--beyond mere classification accuracy. Third, we evaluate the finesse with which CLIP models bridge the image and text modalities. Fourth, we extend our examination to 3D awareness in CLIP models, moving beyond traditional 2D image understanding. Finally, we explore the interaction between vision and language encoders within modern large multimodal models (LMMs) that utilize CLIP as the visual backbone, focusing on how this interaction impacts classification robustness. In each aspect, we consider the impact of six factors on CLIP models: model architecture, training distribution, training set size, fine-tuning, contrastive loss, and test-time prompts. Our study uncovers several previously unknown insights into CLIP. For instance, the architecture of the visual encoder in CLIP plays a significant role in their robustness against 3D corruption. CLIP models tend to exhibit a bias towards shape when making predictions. Moreover, this bias tends to diminish after fine-tuning on ImageNet. Vision-language models like LLaVA, leveraging the CLIP vision encoder, could exhibit benefits in classification performance for challenging categories over CLIP alone. Our findings are poised to offer valuable guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of CLIP models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TPAMI, extension of NeurIPS'23 work: A Closer Look at the Robustness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)</p></details> | None |

We introduce \method{}, a method inspired by the information bottleneck principle that elicits relevant world knowledge from vision and language models which is iteratively refined for generating an explanation of the humor in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments on three datasets confirm the advantage of our method over a range of baselines.

Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear. Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g., extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder, suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff. We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task, FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data, without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> | Master Thesis | None |

Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost. Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents our approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025 workshop BabyLM: Accelerating language modeling research with cognitively plausible datasets</p></details> | None |

This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation. Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100 seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods. Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment.

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

However, existing methods often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism, which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by International Conference on Intelligent Computing 2025</p></details> | None |

Yet, some use cases, like image captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source, lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$ and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as $\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a $\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as with complex models in DRL.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent domain adaptation studies have introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[AuON: A Linear-time Alternative to Semi-Orthogonal Momentum Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24320v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon, improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck. In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit semi-orthogonalization. We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

In contrast, conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores. Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Though previous VLP works have proved the effectiveness of ViTs, they still suffer from computational efficiency brought by the long visual sequence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model with \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mage \textbf{P}atch \textbf{S}election, namely TRIPS, which reduces the visual sequence progressively with a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone for efficient training and inference. The patch-selection layer can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify the attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, TRIPS does not introduce extra parameters to ViTs. Experimental results on a variety of popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TRIPS gain a speedup of 40\% over previous similar VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2022</p></details> | None |

However, their capacity to reason over multiple, visually similar inputs remains insufficiently explored. Such fine-grained comparative reasoning is central to real-world tasks, especially in mathematics and education, where learners must often distinguish between nearly identical diagrams to identify correct solutions. To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses, sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like "maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.</p></details> |  | None |

We conduct the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and, by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain. Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> | None |

Although numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices, offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance.

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios.

Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance.

SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice.

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

A growing body of literature shows that PTLMs fail inconsistently and non-intuitively, demonstrating a lack of reasoning and grounding. To take a first step toward quantifying the effect of grounding (or lack thereof), we curate a novel and comprehensive dataset of object affordances -- Text2Afford, characterized by 15 affordance classes. Unlike affordance datasets collected in vision and language domains, we annotate in-the-wild sentences with objects and affordances. Experimental results reveal that PTLMs exhibit limited reasoning abilities when it comes to uncommon object affordances. We also observe that pre-trained VLMs do not necessarily capture object affordances effectively. Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances.

| **[Understanding and Enhancing Mask-Based Pretraining towards Universal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21650v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success, its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less") linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers) applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for state-of-the-art models.

| **[Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (camera-ready)</p></details> | None |
| **[Bi-VLA: Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18865v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity, torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models, limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision. Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks.

With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI), the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives, along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa ($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters, nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025), Workshop on Curated Data for Efficient Learning</p></details> | None |

However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, most multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, while their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early to reduce the likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and model-centric approaches. We also emphasise deeper integration across multiple levels of multimodality and multidisciplinary collaboration to significantly broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response, self-driving car design, and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability, and finance. By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal impact.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and (2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |

However, the application of prompt learning with VLM in federated learning (FL) scenarios remains underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning (VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various FL and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL). Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SERVAL: Surprisingly Effective Zero-Shot Visual Document Retrieval Powered by Large Vision and Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15432v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) typically operates as text-to-image retrieval using specialized bi-encoders trained to directly embed document images. We revisit a zero-shot generate-and-encode pipeline: a vision-language model first produces a detailed textual description of each document image, which is then embedded by a standard text encoder. On the ViDoRe-v2 benchmark, the method reaches 63.4% nDCG@5, surpassing the strongest specialised multi-vector visual document encoder. It also scales better to large collections and offers broader multilingual coverage. Analysis shows that modern vision-language models capture complex textual and visual cues with sufficient granularity to act as a reusable semantic proxy. By offloading modality alignment to pretrained vision-language models, our approach removes the need for computationally intensive text-image contrastive training and establishes a strong zero-shot baseline for future VDR systems.</p></details> | Accepted | None |
| **[Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings.

However, designing these accelerators is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that does not scale well. While prior efforts have sought to automate DNN accelerator generation, they offer limited parameterization, cannot produce high-performance, tapeout-ready designs, provide limited support for datatypes and quantization schemes, and lack an integrated, end-to-end software compiler. This work proposes Voyager, a high-level synthesis (HLS)-based framework for design space exploration (DSE) and generation of DNN accelerators. Voyager overcomes the limitations of prior work by offering extensive configurability across technology nodes, clock frequencies, and scales, with customizable parameters such as number of processing elements, on-chip buffer sizes, and external memory bandwidth. Voyager supports a wider variety of datatypes and quantization schemes versus prior work, including both built-in floating-point, posit and integer formats, as well as user-defined formats with both per-tensor scaling and microscaling quantization. Voyager's PyTorch-based compiler efficiently maps networks end-to-end on the generated hardware, with support for quantization, fusion, and tiling. We evaluate Voyager on state-of-the-art vision and language models. Voyager enables fast DSE with full-dataset accuracy evaluation for datatypes and quantization schemes. Generated designs achieve a high utilization across models and scales, up to 99.8%, and outperform prior generators with up to 61% lower latency and 56% lower area. Compared to hand-optimized accelerators, Voyager achieves comparable performance, while offering much greater automation in design and workload mapping.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoupled Proxy Alignment: Mitigating Language Prior Conflict for Multimodal Alignment in MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14735v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities. Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue, language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets, model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it a robust approach for vision-language alignment.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving.

Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors have equal contributions; Published as a conference paper in HPCA 2025; 13 pages, 14 figures</p></details> | None |

Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.</p></details> | 23 pages | None |
| **[Image Recognition with Vision and Language Embeddings of VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09311v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/gonikisgo/bmvc2025-vlm-image-recognition.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/gonikisgo/bmvc2025-vlm-image-recognition) |
| **[Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Visual Navigation Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07488v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original BLIP-2 model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[T-araVLN: Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06644v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves SR from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces NE from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[Efficient Alignment of Unconditioned Action Prior for Language-conditioned Pick and Place in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09423v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.

| **[Soft-TransFormers for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16073v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the Well-initialized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (WLTH), which provides suboptimal fine-tuning solutions, we propose a novel fully fine-tuned continual learning (CL) method referred to as Soft-TransFormers (Soft-TF). Soft-TF sequentially learns and selects an optimal soft-network for each task. During sequential training in CL, a well-initialized Soft-TF mask optimizes the weights of sparse layers to obtain task-adaptive soft (real-valued) networks, while keeping the well-pre-trained layer parameters frozen. In inference, the identified task-adaptive network of Soft-TF masks the parameters of the pre-trained network, mapping to an optimal solution for each task and minimizing Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) - the soft-masking preserves the knowledge of the pre-trained network. Extensive experiments on the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Language Transformer (Bert) demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-TF, achieving state-of-the-art performance across Vision and Language Class Incremental Learning (CIL) scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VASSO: Variance Suppression for Sharpness-Aware Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02433v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable generalization-computation tradeoff.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fair Resource Allocation for Fleet Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03353v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments, leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11% in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing insights for equitable fleet intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of Peers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01610v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to 57%</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Model Unmerging: Making Your Models Unmergeable for Secure Model Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01548v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However, as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information. Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over 95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods, further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging.

| **[DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00598v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), under review</p></details> | None |
| **[Cross-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09623v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The accepted manuscript by Pattern Recognition 25 Journal.

While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

| **[Expert Routing with Synthetic Data for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17009v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world settings, regulations and economic incentives permit the sharing of models but not data across institutional boundaries. In such scenarios, practitioners might hope to adapt models to new domains, without losing performance on previous domains (so-called catastrophic forgetting). While any single model may struggle to achieve this goal, learning an ensemble of domain-specific experts offers the potential to adapt more closely to each individual institution. However, a core challenge in this context is determining which expert to deploy at test time. In this paper, we propose Generate to Discriminate (G2D), a domain-incremental continual learning method that leverages synthetic data to train a domain-discriminator that routes samples at inference time to the appropriate expert. Surprisingly, we find that leveraging synthetic data in this capacity is more effective than using the samples to \textit{directly} train the downstream classifier (the more common approach to leveraging synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature). We observe that G2D outperforms competitive domain-incremental learning methods on tasks in both vision and language modalities, providing a new perspective on the use of synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Know "No" Better: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Negation Awareness in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10913v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the extended trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning, and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising 13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets. To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal coordinate information to ensure efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |

Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN (https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.

We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

However, these pretrained embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose visual and cross-modal capabilities. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during fine-tuning.

However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text, curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework, termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1) We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Probing the Representational Power of Sparse Autoencoders in Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11277v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Findings | None |
| **[BERT-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Plots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13184v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models lack effective error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set, uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09262v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments.

Multi-agent systems comprise specialized agents who collaborate to solve a (complex) task. A core security property is robustness, stating that the system should maintain its integrity under adversarial attacks. However, the design of existing multi-agent systems lacks the robustness consideration, as a successful exploit against one agent can spread and infect other agents to undermine the entire system's assurance. To address this, we propose a new defense approach, Cowpox, to provably enhance the robustness of multi-agent systems. It incorporates a distributed mechanism, which improves the recovery rate of agents by limiting the expected number of infections to other agents. The core idea is to generate and distribute a special cure sample that immunizes an agent against the attack before exposure and helps recover the already infected agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cowpox empirically and provide theoretical robustness guarantees.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 Figures, | None |

However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap, we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560 episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of 0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN) baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field.

Prior works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process, exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Probabilistic Stability Guarantees for Feature Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13787v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability guarantees have emerged as a principled way to evaluate feature attributions, but existing certification methods rely on heavily smoothed classifiers and often produce conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that yields non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution method. Moreover, we show that mild smoothing achieves a more favorable trade-off between accuracy and stability, avoiding the aggressive compromises made in prior certification methods. To explain this behavior, we use Boolean function analysis to derive a novel characterization of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of explanation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While learning rate schedules fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks, particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations. In addition, the optimal learning rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training process inefficient. In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA) schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under different constrained training budgets. First, we bridge the gap by constructing a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts for the robustness to landscape curvature variations. From this framework, we derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter \varphi that provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between \varphi and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of \varphi. We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results. Extensive experimental results show that UBA consistently surpasses the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IKOD: Mitigating Visual Attention Degradation in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03469v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows, yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost. Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient framework applicable to various models.</p></details> |  | None |

The standard paradigm uses hand-crafted dictionaries of potential data queries curated by a domain expert or a large language model after a human prompt. However, in practice, hand-crafted dictionaries are limited by the expertise of the curator and the heuristics of prompt engineering. This paper introduces a novel approach: learning a dictionary of interpretable queries directly from the dataset. Our query dictionary learning problem is formulated as an optimization problem by augmenting IP's variational formulation with learnable dictionary parameters. To formulate learnable and interpretable queries, we leverage the latent space of large vision and language models like CLIP. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a new query dictionary learning algorithm inspired by classical sparse dictionary learning. Our experiments demonstrate that learned dictionaries significantly outperform hand-crafted dictionaries generated with large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Current methods often rely on Vision and Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues, we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

However, they face challenges in integrating multimodal inputs commonly used in robotics like vision and language into their framework. To fully maximize DMPs' potential, enabling them to handle multimodal inputs is essential. In addition, we also aim to extend DMPs' capability to handle object-focused tasks requiring one-shot complex motion generation, as observation occlusion could easily happen mid-execution in such tasks (e.g., knife occlusion in cake icing, hand occlusion in dough kneading, etc.). A promising approach is to leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which process multimodal data and can grasp high-level concepts. However, they typically lack enough knowledge and capabilities to directly infer low-level motion details and instead only serve as a bridge between high-level instructions and low-level control. To address this limitation, we propose Keyword Labeled Primitive Selection and Keypoint Pairs Generation Guided Movement Primitives (KeyMPs), a framework that combines VLMs with sequencing of DMPs. KeyMPs use VLMs' high-level reasoning capability to select a reference primitive through \emph{keyword labeled primitive selection} and VLMs' spatial awareness to generate spatial scaling parameters used for sequencing DMPs by generalizing the overall motion through \emph{keypoint pairs generation}, which together enable one-shot vision-language guided motion generation that aligns with the intent expressed in the multimodal input. We validate our approach through experiments on two occlusion-rich tasks: object cutting, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, and cake icing, performed in simulation. These evaluations demonstrate superior performance over other DMP-based methods that integrate VLM support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access, Jul 14 2025</p></details> | None |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICNSLP 2025</p></details> | None |

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IMU: Influence-guided Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01620v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV2025.

While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their potential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to enhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an FL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct high-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One promising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific data of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at any FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can steal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign scenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV2...</summary><p>ICCV2025 camera-ready version</p></details> | None |

However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input", and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal AI models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM Dataset Track 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities.

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</p></details> | 51 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Token Reduction Should Go Beyond Efficiency in Generative Models -- From Vision, Language to Multimodality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18227v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ZLKong/Awesome-Collection-Token-Reduction</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZLKong/Awesome-Collection-Token-Reduction) |

However, conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information. Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets, demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization in Point Clouds with Vision-Language Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14346v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a 3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions captured by the head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment with vision-language guidance. By assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. The learning process is enhanced using concurrently collected vision and language signals to improve multimodal alignment. The learned encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action recognition baselines.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 | None |

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19, significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding, extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising diverse dermatological conditions.

Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024) showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over 500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's developmental experiences.</p></details> |  | None |

The model applies learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets. Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to spectral sparsity priors. In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost. This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design without overparameterized architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97% accuracy at genus and 94% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (Workshop CV4Animals: Computer Vision for Animal Behavior Tracking and Modeling)</p></details> | None |

Most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically learn a set of embeddings to find the optimal match for each view's text and compute similarity. However, the visual and text embeddings learned through these approaches have limited information capacity and are prone to interference from locally similar negative samples. To address this issue, we argue that the information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation. Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of sparse text embeddings. Our proposed D2S-VSE model is extensively evaluated on the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation.

In this paper, we hypothesise that a key factor may be the often-overlooked but crucial step shared by many bias mitigation methods: the definition of subgroups. To investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse, fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition in bias mitigation and presents it as an alternative lever for improving the robustness and fairness of machine learning models.</p></details> |  | None |

One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba" with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.</p></details> |  | None |

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

| **[Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01628v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce harmonic loss as an alternative supervisory signal for training neural networks and large language models (LLMs). Harmonic loss differs from standard cross-entropy loss by (a) replacing the usual SoftMax normalization with a scale-invariant HarMax function and (b) computing logits via Euclidean distance rather than a dot product. Harmonic loss enables improved interpretability and faster convergence, owing to its scale invariance and finite convergence point by design, which can be interpreted as a class center. We first validate the performance of harmonic models across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss perform better than standard models by: (a) enhancing interpretability, (b) requiring less data for generalization, and (c) reducing grokking. Moreover, we compare a GPT-2 model trained with harmonic loss to the standard GPT-2, illustrating that the harmonic model develops more interpretable representations. Looking forward, we believe harmonic loss may become a valuable tool in domains with limited data availability or in high-stakes applications where interpretability and reliability are paramount, paving the way for more robust and efficient neural network models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures; The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> | None |

The growing size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC). Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach, our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance on the MM-IMDB dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.14856</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, has been accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SoftSignSGD(S3): An Enhanced Optimizer for Practical DNN Training and Loss Spikes Minimization Beyond Adam](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06464v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator, departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance) preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3 minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3 incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module, accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task performance.</p></details> | 20pages, 11pages | None |
| **[FACap: A Large-scale Fashion Dataset for Fine-grained Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07135v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

| **[Fair Domain Generalization: An Information-Theoretic View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05823v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges remain in integrating speech, text, and vision into a unified model, especially for spoken tasks. Speech generation methods vary (some produce speech directly), others through text (but their impact on quality is unclear). Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |

Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.</p></details> |  | None |

While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and explainable video description generation process can function as a fully automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2501.08460</p></details> | None |
| **[UniAud: A Unified Auditing Framework for High Auditing Power and Utility with One Training Run](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04457v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private (DP) optimization has been widely adopted as a standard approach to provide rigorous privacy guarantees for training datasets. DP auditing verifies whether a model trained with DP optimization satisfies its claimed privacy level by estimating empirical privacy lower bounds through hypothesis testing. Recent O(1) frameworks improve auditing efficiency by checking the membership status of multiple audit samples in a single run, rather than checking individual samples across multiple runs. However, we reveal that there is no free lunch for this improved efficiency: data dependency and an implicit conflict between auditing and utility impair the tightness of the auditing results. Addressing these challenges, our key insights include reducing data dependency through uncorrelated data and resolving the auditing-utility conflict by decoupling the criteria for effective auditing and separating objectives for utility and auditing. We first propose a unified framework, UniAud, for data-independent auditing that maximizes auditing power through a novel uncorrelated canary construction and a self-comparison framework. We then extend this framework as UniAud++ for data-dependent auditing, optimizing the auditing and utility trade-off through multi-task learning with separate objectives for auditing and training. Experimental results validate that our black-box O(1) framework matches the state-of-the-art auditing results of O(T) auditing with thousands of runs, demonstrating the best efficiency-auditing trade-off across vision and language tasks. Additionally, our framework provides meaningful auditing with only slight utility degradation compared to standard DP training, showing the optimal utility-auditing trade-off and the benefit of requiring no extra training for auditing.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

AirStar accepts natural interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering, intelligent filming, and target tracking.

Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \& Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG) and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

It remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further, this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction.

However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of large-scale MLLMs (l-MLLMs) limit their use in resource-constrained scenarios. Although small-scale MLLMs (s-MLLMs) are designed to reduce computational costs, they typically suffer from performance degradation. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to transfer teacher model's robust representations across both visual and linguistic modalities, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer teacher model's ability to capture visual token relationships. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of the proposed distillation strategy: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to strengthen the alignment between visual-linguistic representations in s-MLLMs, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the s-MLLMs with multimodal understanding capacity, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to refine s-MLLM's knowledge. Our approach significantly improves s-MLLMs performance without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.
