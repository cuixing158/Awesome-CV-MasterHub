Comprehensive documentation is essential for long-term software maintenance and collaboration, yet current automated approaches still fail to model the rich semantic dependencies and architectural structures that define real-world software systems. We present \textbf{CodeWiki}, a unified framework for automated repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki introduces three key innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context across multiple levels of granularity, (ii) recursive multi-agent processing with dynamic task delegation for scalable generation, and (iii) multi-modal synthesis that integrates textual descriptions with visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data-flow representations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce \textbf{CodeWikiBench}, a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-dimensional rubrics and LLM-based assessment protocols. Experimental results show that CodeWiki achieves a 68.79\% quality score with proprietary models, outperforming the closed-source DeepWiki baseline (64.06\%) by 4.73\%, with particularly strong improvements on high-level scripting languages (+10.47\%). We open-source CodeWiki to foster future research and community adoption.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE) |
| **[CVChess: A Deep Learning Framework for Converting Chessboard Images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11522v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move</p></details> |  | None |

It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks. Trained on 62K+ CT, MRI, and PET volumes spanning over 1K anatomical and pathological classes, VoxTell uses multi-stage vision-language fusion across decoder layers to align textual and visual features at multiple scales. It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

| **[Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17760v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms often lose research utility when manufacturer support ends, preventing integration of modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WEAVE: Unleashing and Benchmarking the In-context Interleaved Comprehension and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11434v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages,12 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The First Workshop on Confabulation, Hallucinations, & Overgeneration in Multilingual & Precision-critical Setting - AACL-IJCNLP2025</p></details> | None |
| **[OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01727v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> | None |
| **[SimuFreeMark: A Noise-Simulation-Free Robust Watermarking Against Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11295v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level visual and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Φeat: Physically-Grounded Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11270v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

| **[Beyond Flatlands: Unlocking Spatial Intelligence by Decoupling 3D Reasoning from Numerical Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11239v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Meme Emotion Understanding with Multi-Level Modality Enhancement and Dual-Stage Modal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11126v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

| **[Axis-Aligned Document Dewarping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15000v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing learning-based methods rely heavily on supervised regression with annotated data without fully leveraging the inherent geometric properties of physical documents. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is defined by its axis-aligned feature lines. This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid geometry in planar documents. Harnessing this property, we introduce three synergistic contributions: for the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping; for the inference phase, we propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping difficulty; and for the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing benchmarks, improving the AAD metric by 18.2% to 34.5%.

| **[Accelerating Controllable Generation via Hybrid-grained Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11031v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EmoVid: A Multimodal Emotion Video Dataset for Emotion-Centric Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11002v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TPAMI 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io) |
| **[Text-guided Weakly Supervised Framework for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10958v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[OIDA-QA: A Multimodal Benchmark for Analyzing the Opioid Industry Documents Archive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09914v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

However, despite advancements, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs performance in multi-object sentiment analysis, a key task in semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce MOSABench, a novel evaluation dataset designed specifically for multi-object sentiment analysis. MOSABench includes approximately 1,000 images with multiple objects, requiring MLLMs to independently assess the sentiment of each object, thereby reflecting real-world complexities. Key innovations in MOSABench include distance-based target annotation, post-processing for evaluation to standardize outputs, and an improved scoring mechanism. Our experiments reveal notable limitations in current MLLMs: while some models, like mPLUG-owl and Qwen-VL2, demonstrate effective attention to sentiment-relevant features, others exhibit scattered focus and performance declines, especially as the spatial distance between objects increases. This research underscores the need for MLLMs to enhance accuracy in complex, multi-object sentiment analysis tasks and establishes MOSABench as a foundational tool for advancing sentiment analysis capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks primarily encode target labels into one-dimensional tensors, leading to a loss of fine-grained visual information and overfitting to model-specific features during noise generation. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various settings.</p></details> | AAAI-26 (Oral) | None |

Our model jointly optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3) identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants (GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63, AUC = 0.61) and stability.

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies.

However, effectively leveraging these models remains a challenge. We identify temporal entanglement as a critical, inherent issue when using these time-invariant models in sequential decision-making tasks. This entanglement arises because PVRs, optimised for static image understanding, struggle to represent the temporal dependencies crucial for visuomotor control. In this work, we quantify the impact of temporal entanglement, demonstrating a strong correlation between a policy's success rate and the ability of its latent space to capture task-progression cues. Based on these insights, we propose a simple, yet effective disentanglement baseline designed to mitigate temporal entanglement. Our empirical results show that traditional methods aimed at enriching features with temporal components are insufficient on their own, highlighting the necessity of explicitly addressing temporal disentanglement for robust visuomotor policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission replaces our earlier work "When Pre-trained Visual Representations Fall Short: Limitations in Visuo-Motor Robot Learning."

| **[Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18925v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA) |

Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority. The system is validated in a representative bolting operation involving pipe flange joining, under several fault conditions. The results demonstrate improved fault detection capabilities, enhanced operator situational awareness, and accurate and compliant execution of the bolting operation. However, they also reveal the limitations of relying on a single camera to achieve full situational awareness.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, evaluating LLMs across diverse urban tasks faces two critical challenges: lack of unified platforms for consistent multi-source data access and fragmented task definitions that hinder fair comparison. To address these challenges, we present CityVerse, the first unified platform integrating multi-source urban data, capability-based task taxonomy, and dynamic simulation for systematic LLM evaluation in urban contexts. CityVerse provides: 1) coordinate-based Data APIs unifying ten categories of urban data-including spatial features, temporal dynamics, demographics, and multi-modal imagery-with over 38 million curated records; 2) Task APIs organizing 43 urban computing tasks into a four-level cognitive hierarchy: Perception, Spatial Understanding, Reasoning and Prediction, and Decision and Interaction, enabling standardized evaluation across capability levels; 3) an interactive visualization frontend supporting real-time data retrieval, multi-layer display, and simulation replay for intuitive exploration and validation. We validate the platform's effectiveness through evaluations on mainstream LLMs across representative tasks, demonstrating its capability to support reproducible and systematic assessment.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.</p></details> | Journal resubmission | None |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents two attention-guided autoencoder architectures that address these constraints through complementary anomaly-detection strategies. The first employs a multi-scale structural-similarity (4-MS-SSIM) index for inline inspection, enabling interpretable, real-time defect detection on constrained hardware. The second applies a Mahalanobis-distance analysis of randomly reduced latent features for efficient feature-space monitoring and lifecycle verification. Both approaches share a lightweight backbone optimised for high-resolution imagery for typical manufacturing conditions. Evaluations on the Surface Seal Image (SSI) dataset-representing sterile-barrier packaging inspection-demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform reference baselines, including MOCCA, CPCAE, and RAG-PaDiM, under realistic industrial constraints. Cross-domain validation on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark confirms comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art anomaly-detection methods. The dual-mode framework integrates inline anomaly detection and supervisory monitoring, advancing explainable AI architectures toward greater reliability, observability, and lifecycle monitoring in safety-critical manufacturing environments.

However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is being withdrawn because we have identified a significant error in the implementation of our self-supervised clustering approach.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores.

While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality.

| **[Next-Frame Feature Prediction for Multimodal Deepfake Detection and Temporal Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10212v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, Multimodal Deepfake detection</p></details> | None |
| **[Effector: A Python package for regional explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02629v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effector is a Python package for interpreting machine learning (ML) models that are trained on tabular data through global and regional feature effects. Global effects, like Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), are widely used for explaining tabular ML models due to their simplicity -- each feature's average influence on the prediction is summarized by a single 1D plot. However, when features are interacting, global effects can be misleading. Regional effects address this by partitioning the input space into disjoint subregions with minimal interactions within each and computing a separate regional effect per subspace. Regional effects are then visualized by a set of 1D plots per feature. Effector provides efficient implementations of state-of-the-art global and regional feature effects methods under a unified API. The package integrates seamlessly with major ML libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch. It is designed to be modular and extensible, and comes with comprehensive documentation and tutorials. Effector is an open-source project publicly available on Github at https://github.com/givasile/effector.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/givasile/effector) |

Unlike traditional cameras, spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction methods to become perceptible to the human eye. However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work, we propose Diff-SPK, a diffusion-based reconstruction method. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information under diverse low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, the encoded ETFI by a suitable encoder serve as the input of ControlNet for high-speed scenes generation. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature fusion module during the generation process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GEA: Generation-Enhanced Alignment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10154v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details and extended results are available at https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA.</p></details> | 8pages,3figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/sugelamyd123/Sup-for-GEA) |

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MTAttack: Multi-Target Backdoor Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10098v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

Automatic Identification and Interpretation of Physical Plausibility Failure Modes with Matryoshka Transcoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10094v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After supplementary experiments and careful review, minor inconsistencies in prompt template configuration and partial experimental parameter records were identified.

However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, AAAI26 conference Camera-Ready</p></details> | None |

Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Analyzing and studying MCER issues is significant to affective computing, intelligent recommendations, and human-computer interaction fields. Unlike the traditional single-utterance multi-modal emotion recognition or single-modal conversation emotion recognition, MCER is a more challenging problem that needs to deal with more complex emotional interaction relationships. The critical issue is learning consistency and complementary semantics for multi-modal feature fusion based on emotional interaction relationships. To solve this problem, people have conducted extensive research on MCER based on deep learning technology, but there is still a lack of systematic review of the modeling methods. Therefore, a timely and comprehensive overview of MCER's recent advances in deep learning is of great significance to academia and industry. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of MCER modeling methods and roughly divide MCER methods into four categories, i.e., context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, speaker-differentiated modeling, and speaker-relationship modeling. In addition, we further discuss MCER's publicly available popular datasets, multi-modal feature extraction methods, application areas, existing challenges, and future development directions. We hope that our review can help MCER researchers understand the current research status in emotion recognition, provide some inspiration, and develop more efficient models.</p></details> | 36 pages, 10 figures | None |

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.</p></details> | Accepted in WACV2026 | None |

In neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar information. In this work, we explore a critical question: does superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way? We hypothesize that models which represent the same features in different superposition arrangements, i.e., their neurons have different linear combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics (semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment than expected. We develop a theory for how permutation metrics are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for DNN-DNN and DNN-brain linear regression alignment in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment between neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these requirements, we introduce FeatureEndo-4DGS (FE-4DGS), the first real time pipeline leveraging feature-distilled 4D Gaussian Splatting for simultaneous reconstruction and semantic segmentation of deformable surgical environments. Unlike prior feature-distilled methods restricted to static scenes, and existing 4D approaches that lack semantic integration, FE-4DGS seamlessly leverages pre-trained 2D semantic embeddings to produce a unified 4D representation-where semantics also deform with tissue motion. This unified approach enables the generation of real-time RGB and semantic outputs through a single, parallelized rasterization process. Despite the additional complexity from feature distillation, FE-4DGS sustains real-time rendering (61 FPS) with a compact footprint, achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on EndoNeRF (39.1 PSNR) and SCARED (27.3 PSNR), and delivers competitive EndoVis18 segmentation, matching or exceeding strong 2D baselines for binary segmentation tasks (0.93 DSC) and remaining competitive for multi-label segmentation (0.77 DSC).</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures; Accepted to ML4H 2025</p></details> | None |

The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables | None |

However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI.

While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats, such as scene graphs, has not been widely addressed, resulting in complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces vS-Graphs, a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and floors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs achieves an average of 15.22% accuracy gain across all tested datasets compared to state-of-the-art VSLAM methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to that of precise LiDAR-based frameworks, using only visual features.

However, existing driving datasets for dense semantic perception are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing methods for diverse semantic perception tasks on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 8012 images, half of which (4006) are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality pixel-level panoptic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. 1503 of the corresponding normal-condition images feature panoptic annotations, raising the total annotated images to 5509. ACDC supports the standard tasks of semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, as well as the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.

Existing AI-generated image detection (AGID) methods often overfit to known generators and falter on outputs from newer or unseen models. We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT2), a comprehensive benchmark of 166,000 images, comprising both real and synthetic prompt-image pairs produced by six state-of-the-art T2I systems: Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, SD3 Medium, SD3.5 Large, DALL.E 3, and Midjourney 6. We curate two distinct subsets: COCOAI, featuring structured captions from MS COCO, and TwitterAI, containing narrative-style tweets from The New York Times. Under a unified zero-shot evaluation, we benchmark 17 leading AGID models and observe alarmingly low detection accuracy, 58% on COCOAI and 58.34% on TwitterAI. To transcend binary classification, we propose the Visual AI Index (VAI), an interpretable, prompt-agnostic realism metric based on twelve low-level visual features, enabling us to quantify and rank the perceptual quality of generated outputs with greater nuance. Correlation analysis reveals a moderate inverse relationship between VAI and detection accuracy: Pearson of -0.532 on COCOAI and -0.503 on TwitterAI, suggesting that more visually realistic images tend to be harder to detect, a trend observed consistently across generators. We release COCOAI, TwitterAI, and all codes to catalyze future advances in generalized AGID and perceptual realism assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |

We present an adaptive multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%) for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies (index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis; patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Knowledge-Guided Brain Tumor Segmentation via Synchronized Visual-Semantic-Topological Prior Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08574v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Brain tumor segmentation requires precise delineation of hierarchical structures from multi-sequence MRI. However, existing deep learning methods primarily rely on visual features, showing insufficient discriminative power in ambiguous boundary regions. Moreover, they lack explicit integration of medical domain knowledge such as anatomical semantics and geometric topology. Methods: We propose a knowledge-guided framework, Synchronized Tri-modal Prior Fusion (STPF), that explicitly integrates three heterogeneous knowledge priors: pathology-driven differential features (T1ce-T1, T2-FLAIR, T1/T2) encoding contrast patterns; unsupervised semantic descriptions transformed into voxel-level guidance via spatialization operators; and geometric constraints extracted through persistent homology analysis. A dual-level fusion architecture dynamically allocates prior weights at the voxel level based on confidence and at the sample level through hypernetwork-generated conditional vectors. Furthermore, nested output heads structurally ensure the hierarchical constraint ET subset TC subset WT. Results: STPF achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.868 on the BraTS 2020 dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 2.6 percentage points (3.09% relative improvement). Notably, five-fold cross-validation yields coefficients of variation between 0.23% and 0.33%, demonstrating stable performance. Additionally, ablation experiments show that removing topological and semantic priors leads to performance degradation of 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Conclusions: By explicitly integrating medical knowledge priors - anatomical semantics and geometric constraints - STPF improves segmentation accuracy in ambiguous boundary regions while demonstrating generalization capability and clinical deployment potential.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Enriching Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Modal Teacher Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09286v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[NeuroCLIP: Brain-Inspired Prompt Tuning for EEG-to-Image Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09250v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spatial Information Bottleneck for Interpretable Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09239v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Most of the existing AVTSE methods encode visual and audio features simultaneously, resulting in extremely high computational complexity and making it impractical for real-time processing on edge devices. To tackle this issue, we proposed a two-stage ultra-compact AVTSE system. Specifically, in the first stage, a compact network is employed for voice activity detection (VAD) using visual information. In the second stage, the VAD results are combined with audio inputs to isolate the target speaker's voice. Experiments show that the proposed system effectively suppresses background noise and interfering voices while spending little computational resources.</p></details> |  | None |

Many intelligent systems, such as electronic payment and identity verification, rely on face forgery detection. Although face forgery detection has successfully distinguished fake faces, recent studies have demonstrated that face forgery detectors are very vulnerable to adversarial examples. Meanwhile, existing attacks rely on network architectures or training datasets instead of the predicted labels, which leads to a gap in attacking deployed applications. To narrow this gap, we first explore the decision-based attacks on face forgery detection. We identify challenges in directly applying existing decision-based attacks, such as perturbation initialization failure and reduced image quality. To overcome these issues, we propose cross-task perturbation to handle initialization failures by utilizing the high correlation of face features on different tasks. Additionally, inspired by the use of frequency cues in face forgery detection, we introduce the frequency decision-based attack. This attack involves adding perturbations in the frequency domain while constraining visual quality in the spatial domain. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance on FaceForensics++, CelebDF, and industrial APIs, with high query efficiency and guaranteed image quality. Further, the fake faces by our method can pass face forgery detection and face recognition, which exposes the security problems of face forgery detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> | None |

However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | [Code Link](https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo) |

However, many of these stone structures in remote or vegetated landscapes remain undocumented due to limited accessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based segmentation offers a scalable approach for automated mapping of such features, but challenges remain: the visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation and the scarcity of labeled training data. This study presents DINO-CV, a self-supervised cross-view pre-training framework based on knowledge distillation, designed for accurate mapping of dry-stone walls using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from airborne LiDAR. By learning invariant structural representations across multiple DEM-derived views, specifically Multi-directional Hillshade (MHS) and Visualization for Archaeological Topography (VAT), DINO-CV addresses both occlusion and data scarcity challenges. Applied to the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape (Victoria, Australia), a UNESCO World Heritage site, the approach achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains 63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM derivatives for large-scale, automated mapping of cultural heritage features in complex and vegetated environments. Beyond archaeology, this approach offers a scalable solution for environmental monitoring and heritage preservation across inaccessible or environmentally sensitive regions.</p></details> |  | None |

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ROI-based Deep Image Compression with Implicit Bit Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08918v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, journal</p></details> | None |
| **[Negative Entity Suppression for Zero-Shot Captioning with Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08909v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g., Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end training strategy leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector. Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets corrupted by generated turbulence.</p></details> | Accepted to WACV2026 | None |

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features.

Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce \ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework.

Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training. These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes.

Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed Mg-MRN method.

Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[When Object-Centric World Models Meet Policy Learning: From Pixels to Policies, and Where It Breaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06136v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.</p></details> |  | None |

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection.

| **[AVAR-Net: A Lightweight Audio-Visual Anomaly Recognition Framework with a Benchmark Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13630v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation, healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition research.</p></details> | <details><summary>I wou...</summary><p>I would like to request the withdrawal of my paper .

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Pattern Recognition for possible publication</p></details> | None |

To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.</p></details> |  | None |

To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions. Extensive experiments on the Places365 and COCOA datasets demonstrate that CSF-Net effectively reduces object hallucination while enhancing visual realism and semantic alignment.

To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReIDMamba: Learning Discriminative Features with Visual State Space Model for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07948v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> |  | None |

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Effectively eliciting comprehensive reasoning from VLMs on such intricate visual elements remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present VipAct, an agent framework that enhances VLMs by integrating multi-agent collaboration and vision expert models, enabling more precise visual understanding and comprehensive reasoning. VipAct consists of an orchestrator agent, which manages task requirement analysis, planning, and coordination, along with specialized agents that handle specific tasks such as image captioning and vision expert models that provide high-precision perceptual information. This multi-agent approach allows VLMs to better perform fine-grained visual perception tasks by synergizing planning, reasoning, and tool use. We evaluate VipAct on benchmarks featuring a diverse set of visual perception tasks, with experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies reveal the critical role of multi-agent collaboration in eliciting more detailed System-2 reasoning and highlight the importance of image input for task planning. Additionally, our error analysis identifies patterns of VLMs' inherent limitations in visual perception, providing insights into potential future improvements. VipAct offers a flexible and extensible framework, paving the way for more advanced visual perception systems across various real-world applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (5 main paper+3 refernce), 2 figures, pulished at Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.</p></details> |  | None |

However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper proposes a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fashion recommendation that jointly addresses two key tasks: outfit compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an "outfit token" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset. For complementary item retrieval, a "target item token" representing the desired item description is used to retrieve compatible items, reaching an accuracy of 69.24% under the Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB) metric. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fashion recommendation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure | None |

However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur.

| **[MPJudge: Towards Perceptual Assessment of Music-Induced Paintings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07137v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music induced painting is a unique artistic practice, where visual artworks are created under the influence of music. Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations. Building on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism. To effectively learn from ambiguous cases, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Qualitative results further show that our model more accurately identifies music relevant regions in paintings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GEWDiff: Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07103v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by AAAI-26</p></details> | None |

The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances temporal structure learning by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video frames and moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further consideration, we have concluded that the current version requires revision and may not yet be ready for publication.

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 page, 9 figures, published to PRCV</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. Notably, it improves the challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario by a significant +13.54%.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |
| **[MetricSynth: Framework for Aggregating DORA and KPI Metrics Across Multi-Platform Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06864v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern, large-scale software development, engineering leaders face the significant challenge of gaining a holistic and data-driven view of team performance and system health. Data is often siloed across numerous disparate tools, making manual report generation time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a centralized framework designed to provide near-real-time visibility into developer experience (DevEx) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics for a software ecosystem. By aggregating data from various internal tools and platforms, the system computes and visualizes metrics across key areas such as Developer Productivity, Quality, and Operational Efficiency. The architecture features a cron-based data ingestion layer, a dual-schema data storage approach, a processing engine for metric pre-computation, a proactive alerting system, and utilizes the open-source BI tool Metabase for visualization, all secured with role-based access control (RBAC). The implementation resulted in a significant reduction in manual reporting efforts, saving an estimated 20 person-hours per week, and enabled faster, data-driven bottleneck identification. Finally, we evaluate the system's scalability and discuss its trade-offs, positioning it as a valuable contribution to engineering intelligence platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual decoding.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 | None |

However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.</p></details> | AAAI26 poster | None |
| **[Fine-grained Image Retrieval via Dual-Vision Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16273v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 | None |

Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Temporal Inconsistency Guidance for Super-resolution Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18933v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As super-resolution (SR) techniques introduce unique distortions that fundamentally differ from those caused by traditional degradation processes (e.g., compression), there is an increasing demand for specialized video quality assessment (VQA) methods tailored to SR-generated content. One critical factor affecting perceived quality is temporal inconsistency, which refers to irregularities between consecutive frames. However, existing VQA approaches rarely quantify this phenomenon or explicitly investigate its relationship with human perception. Moreover, SR videos exhibit amplified inconsistency levels as a result of enhancement processes. In this paper, we propose \textit{Temporal Inconsistency Guidance for Super-resolution Video Quality Assessment (TIG-SVQA)} that underscores the critical role of temporal inconsistency in guiding the quality assessment of SR videos. We first design a perception-oriented approach to quantify frame-wise temporal inconsistency. Based on this, we introduce the Inconsistency Highlighted Spatial Module, which localizes inconsistent regions at both coarse and fine scales. Inspired by the human visual system, we further develop an Inconsistency Guided Temporal Module that performs progressive temporal feature aggregation: (1) a consistency-aware fusion stage in which a visual memory capacity block adaptively determines the information load of each temporal segment based on inconsistency levels, and (2) an informative filtering stage for emphasizing quality-related features. Extensive experiments on both single-frame and multi-frame SR video scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VQA approaches.

Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing models, often designed for natural images, fail to address this dual challenge in RS scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose LWGANet, a light-weight backbone engineered for RS-specific properties. LWGANet introduces two core innovations: a Top-K Global Feature Interaction (TGFI) module that mitigates spatial redundancy by focusing computation on salient regions, and a Light-Weight Grouped Attention (LWGA) module that resolves channel redundancy by partitioning channels into specialized, scale-specific pathways. By synergistically resolving these core inefficiencies, LWGANet achieves a superior trade-off between feature representation quality and computational cost. Extensive experiments on twelve diverse datasets across four major RS tasks--scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection--demonstrate that LWGANet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight backbones in both accuracy and efficiency. Our work establishes a new, robust baseline for efficient visual analysis in RS images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features.

Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision-language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised "product recategorization" pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (for example, subtypes of "Shoes") with cluster purities above 86%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms.

OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning.

It's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. Existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways yet fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a unified architecture, Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO). The key to our unification is simply shared quantizing VFM representations in OCL aggregation and decoding. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. We also mathematically analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and why their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision.

However, existing VAE guidance does not explicitly address that objects can vary in pixel sizes while models typically excel at specific pattern scales. We propose \textit{Multi-Scale Fusion} (MSF) to enhance VAE guidance for OCL training. To ensure objects of all sizes fall within VAE's comfort zone, we adopt the \textit{image pyramid}, which produces intermediate representations at multiple scales; To foster scale-invariance/variance in object super-pixels, we devise \textit{inter}/\textit{intra-scale fusion}, which augments low-quality object super-pixels of one scale with corresponding high-quality super-pixels from another scale. On standard OCL benchmarks, our technique improves mainstream methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones.

Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability.

While recent approaches, such as embedding mixing and latent modification based on structural sketches, have been proposed, they often suffer from incompatible semantic information and discrepancies in shape and appearance. In this work, we introduce FreeBlend, an effective, training-free framework designed to address these challenges. To mitigate cross-modal loss and enhance feature detail, we leverage transferred image embeddings as conditional inputs. The framework employs a stepwise increasing interpolation strategy between latents, progressively adjusting the blending ratio to seamlessly integrate auxiliary features. Additionally, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism that updates the auxiliary latents in reverse order, facilitating global blending and preventing rigid or unnatural outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the semantic coherence and visual quality of blended images, yielding compelling and coherent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://petershen-csworld.github.io/FreeBlend</p></details> | [Code Link](https://petershen-csworld.github.io/FreeBlend) |

We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked \| visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content.

However, current LLM-based approaches encounter critical challenges: (1) Failure analysis reveals that frequent collisions and obstructions, stemming from limitations in visual representations, remain primary obstacles to robust driving performance. (2) The substantial parameters of LLMs pose considerable deployment hurdles. To address these limitations, we introduce VLDrive, a novel approach featuring a lightweight MLLM architecture with enhanced vision components. VLDrive achieves compact visual tokens through innovative strategies, including cycle-consistent dynamic visual pruning and memory-enhanced feature aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a distance-decoupled instruction attention mechanism to improve joint visual-linguistic feature learning, particularly for long-range visual tokens. Extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate VLDrive`s effectiveness. Notably, VLDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing parameters by 81% (from 7B to 1.3B), yielding substantial driving score improvements of 15.4%, 16.8%, and 7.6% at tiny, short, and long distances, respectively, in closed-loop evaluations.

In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations}, leading to uninformative representations and significant performance degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local information. We analyze these dimension-concentrated massive activations and uncover that their concentration is inherently linked to the Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) in DiTs. Building on these findings, we propose the \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{F}eature (DiTF), a training-free AdaLN-based framework that extracts semantically discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF leverages AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations through channel-wise modulation. Furthermore, a channel discard strategy is introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of massive activations. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code: https://github.com/ganchaofan0000/DiTF</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ganchaofan0000/DiTF) |

Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4figures | None |
| **[Temporal-Guided Visual Foundation Models for Event-Based Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06238v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer unique advantages for vision tasks in challenging environments, yet processing asynchronous event streams remains an open challenge. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively. Overall, this work unlocks the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning.

However, adapting these models to downstream tasks conventionally requires parameter updates, with even parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods necessitating the modification of thousands to millions of weights. In this paper, we investigate the redundancies in the segment anything model (SAM) and then propose a novel parameter-free fine-tuning method. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that adjust parameters, our method emphasizes selecting, reusing, and enhancing pre-trained features, offering a new perspective on fine-tuning foundation models. Specifically, we introduce a channel selection algorithm based on the model's output difference to identify redundant and effective channels. By selectively replacing the redundant channels with more effective ones, we filter out less useful features and reuse more task-irrelevant features to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the task-specific feature representation. Experiments on both out-of-domain and in-domain datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method in different vision tasks (e.g., image segmentation, depth estimation and image classification). Notably, our approach can seamlessly integrate with existing fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, Adapter), further boosting the performance of already fine-tuned models. Moreover, since our channel selection involves only model inference, our method significantly reduces GPU memory overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DA$^{2}$: Depth Anything in Any Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26618v5)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released.

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning (ML) modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUROC of 1.00 and a testing AUROC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable ML model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

However, drastic appearance variations of images at the same place caused by viewpoint changes can lead to inconsistent supervision signals, thereby degrading descriptor learning. Existing methods either rely on manually defined cropping rules or labeled data for view differentiation, but they suffer from two major limitations: (1) reliance on labels or handcrafted rules restricts generalization capability; (2) even within the same view direction, occlusions can introduce feature ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose MutualVPR, a mutual learning framework that integrates unsupervised view self-classification and descriptor learning. We first group images by geographic coordinates, then iteratively refine the clusters using K-means to dynamically assign place categories without orientation labels. Specifically, we adopt a DINOv2-based encoder to initialize the clustering. During training, the encoder and clustering co-evolve, progressively separating drastic appearance variations of the same place and enabling consistent supervision. Furthermore, we find that capturing fine-grained image differences at a place enhances robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MutualVPR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, validating the effectiveness of our framework in improving view direction generalization, occlusion robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

At each timestep, controllers compute commands using the current pose without waiting for future refinements. While traditional visual SLAM systems achieve high accuracy through retrospective loop closures, these corrections arrive after control decisions were already executed, violating causality. Visual-inertial odometry maintains causality but accumulates unbounded drift over time. To address the distinct requirements of robot control, we propose a multi-camera multi-map visual-inertial localization system providing real-time, causal pose estimation with bounded localization error through continuous map constraints. Since standard trajectory metrics evaluate post-processed trajectories, we analyze the error composition of map-based localization systems and propose a set of evaluation metrics suitable for measuring causal localization performance. To validate our system, we design a multi-camera IMU hardware setup and collect a challenging long-term campus dataset featuring diverse illumination and seasonal conditions. Experimental results on public benchmarks and on our own collected dataset demonstrate that our system provides significantly higher real-time localization accuracy compared to other methods.

However, as scene complexity and visual distractions increase, policies that perform well in simple settings often experience substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose ImitDiff, a diffusion-based imitation learning policy guided by fine-grained semantics within a dual-resolution workflow. Leveraging pretrained priors of vision-language foundation models, our method transforms high-level instructions into pixel-level visual semantic masks. These masks guide a dual-resolution perception pipeline that captures both global context (e.g., overall layout) from low-resolution observation and fine-grained local features (e.g., geometric details) from high-resolution observation, enabling the policy to focus on task-relevant regions. Additionally, we introduce a consistency-driven diffusion transformer action head that bridges visual semantic conditions and real-time action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitDiff outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language manipulation frameworks, as well as visuomotor imitation learning policies, particularly under increased scene complexity and visual distractions. Notably, ImitDiff exhibits strong generalization in zero-shot settings involving novel objects and visual distractions. Furthermore, our consistency-driven action head achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference speed while maintaining competitive success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Understanding Cross Task Generalization in Handwriting-Based Alzheimer's Screening via Vision Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05841v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.</p></details> |  | None |

The simplicity, computability, and stability of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ make it a natural choice of invariant for data analysis applications. In an earlier preprint [arXiv:1512.00180], we introduced a framework for real-time interactive visualization of $\mathcal{F}(M)$, which allows the user to select a single line $\ell$ via a GUI and then plots the associated barcode. This visualization is a key feature of our software RIVET for the visualization and analysis of bipersistent homology. Such interactive visualization requires a framework for efficient queries of $\mathcal{F}(M)$, i.e., for quickly obtaining the barcode along a given line $\ell$. To enable such queries, we introduced a novel data structure based on planar line arrangements, called an augmented arrangement. The aim of the present paper is to give an updated and improved exposition of the parts of our preprint [arXiv:1512.00180] concerning the mathematics of the augmented arrangement and its computation. Notably, by taking the input to be a minimal presentation rather than a chain complex, we are able to substantially simplify our main algorithm and its complexity analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 10 figures; see also earlier preprint arXiv:1512.00180</p></details> | None |

While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FreeSeg-Diff: Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20105v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in tackling many domains and tasks. Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models.

A Text-to-Vec module generates Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving both lip-sync and visual realism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-modal Loop Closure Detection with Foundation Models in Severely Unstructured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05404v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

Existing practices lack a systematic design framework for translating the hierarchical cultural connotations of these garments into dynamic, personalized, and identity-promoting digital experiences. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Three-Layer Cultural Gene Framework that systematically decodes ethnic costumes from their surface-level visual symbols, through their mid-level socio-cultural contexts, to their inner-layer spiritual core. Based on this framework, we designed and implemented an interactive digital platform featuring two key innovations: a "gene-first" exploratory path that encourages curiosity-driven discovery, and an AI-powered co-creation experience. This generative feature allows users to co-create personalized narratives and images based on their understanding of the "inner-layer" genes, transforming them from passive observers into active co-creators. A mixed-methods user study (N=24) was conducted to evaluate the platform. The findings demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances users' cultural cognition, deepens their affective connection, and significantly promotes their sense of cultural identity. This research contributes a validated framework and a practical exemplar for designing generative, identity-building digital experiences for cultural heritage, offering a new pathway for its preservation and revitalization in the digital age.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive and robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in such tasks. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set effectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers relying on OCR-text.

Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions.

Conventional methods are yet to effectively address the integration of both natural and socioeconomic factors in this complex task. In this study, we propose a novel conditional adversarial learning-based method for city street layout generation from natural and socioeconomic conditions. Specifically, we design an image synthesis module that leverages an autoencoder to fuse a set of natural and socioeconomic data for a given region of interest into a feature map, and then employs a conditional generative adversarial network trained on real-world data to synthesize street layout images from the feature map. Afterward, a graph extraction module converts each synthesized image to the corresponding high-quality street layout graph. Experiments and evaluations suggest that the proposed method produces diverse city street layouts that closely resemble their real-world counterparts both visually and structurally. This capability can facilitate the creation of high-quality virtual city scenes.</p></details> | in Chinese language | None |

Existing poisoning attacks compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel countermeasure strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, Project Page https://alisharey.github.io/GeoAware-VLA/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://alisharey.github.io/GeoAware-VLA) |

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models.

The proposed method integrates the BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance. On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP), outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to real-world challenges.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and 105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables, charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required: text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2) multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features (e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world document intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Whereas past sensemaking models have been grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power, articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data, learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and presented at IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> | None |

Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be. Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns. We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology. Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing. Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an ``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cambrian-mllm.github.io</p></details> | None |

Current approaches are limited to static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness. Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models, particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

The primary issue lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions, which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate high-quality videos that align with user intent.

It is widely assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of the target concept.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures | None |

However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM | [Code Link](https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM) |

Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning. Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complicated maritime environment often causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features. Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories. Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise, occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities, preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Embodied Cognition Augmented End2End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01334v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a new paradigm. However, popular end-to-end approaches typically rely on visual feature extraction networks trained under label supervision. This limited supervision framework restricts the generality and applicability of driving models. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm termed $E^{3}AD$, which advocates for comparative learning between visual feature extraction networks and the general EEG large model, in order to learn latent human driving cognition for enhancing end-to-end planning. In this work, we collected a cognitive dataset for the mentioned contrastive learning process. Subsequently, we investigated the methods and potential mechanisms for enhancing end-to-end planning with human driving cognition, using popular driving models as baselines on publicly available autonomous driving datasets. Both open-loop and closed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm significantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the effectiveness of comparative learning process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate human driving cognition for improving end-to-end autonomous driving planning. It represents an initial attempt to incorporate embodied cognitive data into end-to-end autonomous driving, providing valuable insights for future brain-inspired autonomous driving systems.

To achieve this, we introduce a transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that employs both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse- and fine-grained action recognition, effectively exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset by incorporating action hierarchies, resulting in the Hierarchical TSU dataset, a hierarchical dataset designed for monitoring activities of the elderly in home environments. An ablation study assesses the performance impact of different strategies for integrating contextual and hierarchical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA methods on the Hierarchical TSU dataset, Assembly101 and IkeaASM, achieving over a 17% improvement in top-1 accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Drone photographs, with their advantages of easy acquisition, broad coverage, and high spatial resolution, offer a viable approach for large-scale rural environmental perception. However, a systematic methodology for identifying key environmental elements from drone photographs and quantifying their impact on environmental perception remains lacking. To address this gap, a Vision-Language Contrastive Ranking Framework (VLCR) is designed for rural livability assessment in China. The framework employs chain-of-thought prompting strategies to guide multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in identifying visual features related to quality of life and ecological habitability from drone photographs. Subsequently, to address the instability in pairwise village comparison, a text description-constrained drone photograph comparison strategy is proposed. Finally, to overcome the efficiency bottleneck in nationwide pairwise village comparisons, an innovation ranking algorithm based on binary search interpolation is developed, which reduces the number of comparisons through automated selection of comparison targets. The proposed framework achieves superior performance with a Spearman Footrule distance of 0.74, outperforming mainstream commercial MLLMs by approximately 0.1. Moreover, the mechanism of concurrent comparison and ranking demonstrates a threefold enhancement in computational efficiency. Our framework has achieved data innovation and methodological breakthroughs in village livability assessment, providing strong support for large-scale village livability analysis.

Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/umbertocappellazzo/Llama-AVSR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/umbertocappellazzo/Llama-AVSR) |

The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), lack inductive bias to constrain visual features within the linguistic structure of the LLM's embedding space, making them data-hungry and prone to cross-modal misalignment. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where visual and textual modalities are highly correlated. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods, with larger gains on document understanding tasks and under low-resource setups. We provide further analysis demonstrating its efficiency and robustness to noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing debiasing methods often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.</p></details> |  | None |

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in cases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Depression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it difficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and unwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use online social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence, social media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be utilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing approaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of social media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among social media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state, we propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets and (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also extract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a user. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural Network (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to create the visual feature vector for prediction. We contribute a curated Covid-19 dataset of depressed and non-depressed users for research purposes and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in detecting depression during the Covid-19 outbreak. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods over a benchmark dataset by 2%-8% and produces promising results on the Covid-19 dataset. Our analysis highlights the impact of each modality and provides valuable insights into users' mental and emotional states.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by the shared principles between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine image details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing compressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of frequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in images, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the representation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized Features to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we further optimize the compression pipeline by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of our Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame compression. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.

However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Diffusion-Aided Bandwidth-Efficient Semantic Communication with Adaptive Requests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26442v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication focuses on conveying the intrinsic meaning of data rather than its raw symbolic representation. For visual content, this paradigm shifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic structure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches generally follow one of two paths: transmitting only text descriptions, which often fail to capture precise spatial layouts and fine-grained appearance details; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which tends to introduce substantial semantic redundancy. A key challenge, therefore, is to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and visual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper introduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive retransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a limited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based inpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency mechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image and the original text description. When a semantic discrepancy is detected, the receiver triggers a retransmission to request a small set of additional latent blocks and refine the image reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth usage while preserving high semantic accuracy, achieving an efficient balance between reconstruction quality and transmission overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[D-HUMOR: Dark Humor Understanding via Multimodal Open-ended Reasoning -- A Benchmark Dataset and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06771v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

| **[Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, while they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns, compromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes its encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers. To address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially designed feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the encoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded, thereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations and mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the attack success rate from 89.70\% to 2.76\% against the most advanced multimodal attacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Binaspect -- A Python Library for Binaural Audio Analysis, Visualization & Feature Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25714v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Binaspect, an open-source Python library for binaural audio analysis, visualization, and feature generation. Binaspect generates interpretable "azimuth maps" by calculating modified interaural time and level difference spectrograms, and clustering those time-frequency (TF) bins into stable time-azimuth histogram representations. This allows multiple active sources to appear as distinct azimuthal clusters, while degradations manifest as broadened, diffused, or shifted distributions. Crucially, Binaspect operates blindly on audio, requiring no prior knowledge of head models. These visualizations enable researchers and engineers to observe how binaural cues are degraded by codec and renderer design choices, among other downstream processes. We demonstrate the tool on bitrate ladders, ambisonic rendering, and VBAP source positioning, where degradations are clearly revealed. In addition to their diagnostic value, the proposed representations can be exported as structured features suitable for training machine learning models in quality prediction, spatial audio classification, and other binaural tasks. Binaspect is released under an open-source license with full reproducibility scripts at https://github.com/QxLabIreland/Binaspect.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/QxLabIreland/Binaspect) |
