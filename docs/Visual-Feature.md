| **[MMME: A Spontaneous Multi-Modal Micro-Expression Dataset Enabling Visual-Physiological Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09834v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare, criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs. Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841 macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS, establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Handwritten Text Recognition via 3D Attention and Multi-Scale Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18374v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Wukong90/3DAttention-MultiScaleTraining-for-HTR.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Wukong90/3DAttention-MultiScaleTraining-for-HTR) |
| **[DAVSP: Safety Alignment for Large Vision-Language Models via Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09353v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/DAVSP.</p></details> | 16 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/DAVSP) |
| **[Cross-Frame Representation Alignment for Fine-Tuning Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09229v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance. Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability. Project page: https://crepavideo.github.io</p></details> | 24 pages, 25 figures | None |
| **[Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09095v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visualization of a multidimensional point cloud as a 3D swarm of avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06751v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an innovative technique for representing multidimensional datasets using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. Our approach combines classical projection techniques with the explicit assignment of selected data dimensions to avatar (facial) features, leveraging the innate human ability to interpret facial traits. We introduce a semantic division of data dimensions into intuitive and technical categories, assigning the former to avatar features and projecting the latter into a four-dimensional (or higher) spatial embedding. The technique is implemented as a plugin for the open-source dpVision visualization platform, enabling users to interactively explore data in the form of a swarm of avatars whose spatial positions and visual features jointly encode various aspects of the dataset. Experimental results with synthetic test data and a 12-dimensional dataset of Portuguese Vinho Verde wines demonstrate that the proposed method enhances interpretability and facilitates the analysis of complex data structures.</p></details> | 26 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[Learning Speaker-Invariant Visual Features for Lipreading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07572v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color, texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules (Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers, implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting the Semantic Knowledge of Pre-trained Text-Encoders for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01076v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on fixed datasets but struggle with incremental and shifting data in real-world scenarios. Continual learning addresses this challenge by allowing models to learn from new data while retaining previously learned knowledge. Existing methods mainly rely on visual features, often neglecting the rich semantic information encoded in text. The semantic knowledge available in the label information of the images, offers important semantic information that can be related with previously acquired knowledge of semantic classes. Consequently, effectively leveraging this information throughout continual learning is expected to be beneficial. To address this, we propose integrating semantic guidance within and across tasks by capturing semantic similarity using text embeddings. We start from a pre-trained CLIP model, employ the \emph{Semantically-guided Representation Learning (SG-RL)} module for a soft-assignment towards all current task classes, and use the Semantically-guided Knowledge Distillation (SG-KD) module for enhanced knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on general and fine-grained datasets. Our code can be found in https://github.com/aprilsveryown/semantically-guided-continual-learning.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/aprilsveryown/semantically-guided-continual-learning) |
| **[Lightweight Joint Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection via Single-Stream Multi-Modal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07358v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection. However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and impractical for resource-constrained environments. In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Fast and Lightweight Model for Causal Audio-Visual Speech Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06689v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) aims to extract a target speech signal from a mixed signal by leveraging both auditory and visual (lip movement) cues. However, most existing AVSS methods exhibit complex architectures and rely on future context, operating offline, which renders them unsuitable for real-time applications. Inspired by the pipeline of RTFSNet, we propose a novel streaming AVSS model, named Swift-Net, which enhances the causal processing capabilities required for real-time applications. Swift-Net adopts a lightweight visual feature extraction module and an efficient fusion module for audio-visual integration. Additionally, Swift-Net employs Grouped SRUs to integrate historical information across different feature spaces, thereby improving the utilization efficiency of historical information. We further propose a causal transformation template to facilitate the conversion of non-causal AVSS models into causal counterparts. Experiments on three standard benchmark datasets (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrated that under causal conditions, our proposed Swift-Net exhibited outstanding performance, highlighting the potential of this method for processing speech in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[CoMemo: LVLMs Need Image Context with Image Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06279v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

| **[Leopard: A Vision Language Model For Text-Rich Multi-Image Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01744v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data.

| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> | None |
| **[Personalized Interpretability -- Interactive Alignment of Prototypical Parts Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05533v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy of the model.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[LLMs Can Compensate for Deficiencies in Visual Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05439v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2 by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs, including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision, localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations, including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, Website: https://Perceive-Anything.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Cropped Regions: New Benchmark and Corresponding Baseline for Chinese Scene Text Retrieval in Diverse Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04999v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene text retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Visual Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17709v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) often struggle to recognize novel concepts, as they rely on pre-trained knowledge and have limited ability to capture subtle visual details. Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language, improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts, we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Coreset Selection via LLM-based Concept Bottlenecks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16733v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coreset Selection (CS) aims to identify a subset of the training dataset that achieves model performance comparable to using the entire dataset. Many state-of-the-art CS methods select coresets using scores whose computation requires training the downstream model on the entire dataset first and recording changes in the model's behavior on samples as it trains (training dynamics). These scores are inefficient to compute and hard to interpret, as they do not indicate whether a sample is difficult to learn in general or only for a specific downstream model. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing a score that computes a sample's difficulty using human-understandable textual attributes (concepts) independent of any downstream model. Specifically, we measure the alignment between a sample's visual features and concept bottlenecks, derived via large language models, by training a linear concept bottleneck layer and computing the sample's difficulty score using it.We then use stratified sampling based on this score to generate a coreset of the dataset.Crucially, our score is efficiently computable without training the downstream model on the full dataset even once, leads to high-performing coresets for various downstream models, and is computable even for an unlabeled dataset. Through experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K, we show that our coresets outperform random subsets, even at high pruning rates, and achieve model performance comparable to or better than coresets found by training dynamics-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04134v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos) of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1) a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Person Human-Object Interaction Recognition in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03440v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time. Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)</p></details> | None |
| **[GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03143v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated  token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.</p></details> |  | None |

To bridge this gap, we present EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system, EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic, goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise. Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity) or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate, within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scene Structure Guidance Network: Unfolding Graph Partitioning into Pixel-Wise Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00555v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the informative structures of scenes is essential for low-level vision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 14 figures, journal extension version of SSGNet (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25322)</p></details> | None |

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction.

Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark.

As a high-level semantic representation, language provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework, video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules: invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting (STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space, thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub (STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks.

To address this issue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any undesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether training-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side, i.e., texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to limitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image content. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the output side, i.e., generated images, may be more direct and effective, we propose Concept Corrector. It checks target concepts based on visual features provided by final generated images predicted at certain time steps. Further, it incorporates Concept Removal Attention to erase generated concept features. It overcomes the limitations of existing methods, which are either unable to remove the concept features that have been generated in images or rely on the assumption that the related concept words are contained in input prompts. In the whole pipeline, our method changes no model parameters and only requires a given target concept as well as the corresponding replacement content, which is easy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure method based on intermediate-generated images, achieving the ability to erase concepts on the fly. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its impressive erasure performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the 3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs -- including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate consistent performance gains.

Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2) refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction. The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish a benchmark called Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding.

Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1) injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2. Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns.

To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Semantic-guided Representation Learning for Multi-Label Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03801v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue. Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid, precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory, without source data or retraining.

Here, we present a computer vision (CV) viscometer that automates the inverted vial test and enables quantitative viscosity inference across nearly five orders of magnitude (0.01-1000 Pas), without requiring direct velocity field measurements. The system simultaneously inverts multiple vials and records videos of the evolving fluid, which are fed into a neural network that approximates the inverse function from visual features and known fluid density. Despite the complex, multi-regime flow within the vial, our approach achieves relative errors below 25%, improving to 15% for viscosities above 0.1 Pas. When tested on non-Newtonian polymer solutions, the method reliably estimates zero-shear viscosity as long as viscoelastic or shear-thinning behaviors remain negligible within the flow regime. Moreover, high standard deviations in the inferred values may serve as a proxy for identifying fluids with strong non-Newtonian behavior. The CV viscometer requires only one camera and one motor, is contactless and low-cost, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput experimental automated and manual workflows. Transcending traditional characterization paradigms, our method leverages uncontrolled flows and visual features to achieve simplicity and scalability, enabling high-throughput viscosity inference that can meet the growing demand of data-driven material models while remaining accessible to lower resource environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance.

The generated paths can then be tracked using vision-based control, eliminating the need for an explicit robot model or proprioceptive sensing. At the core of our approach is the construction of a roadmap entirely in image space. To achieve this, we explicitly define sampling, nearest-neighbor selection, and collision checking based on visual features rather than geometric models. We first collect a set of image-space samples by moving the robot within its workspace, capturing keypoints along its body at different configurations. These samples serve as nodes in the roadmap, which we construct using either learned or predefined distance metrics. At runtime, the roadmap generates collision-free paths directly in image space, removing the need for a robot model or joint encoders. We validate our approach through an experimental study in which a robotic arm follows planned paths using an adaptive vision-based control scheme to avoid obstacles. The results show that paths generated with the learned-distance roadmap achieved 100% success in control convergence, whereas the predefined image-space distance roadmap enabled faster transient responses but had a lower success rate in convergence.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the feature divergence of an attribute (resp. object) when combined with different objects (resp. attributes), it is challenging to learn disentangled primitive features that are general across different compositions. To this end, we propose the solution of cross-composition feature disentanglement, which takes multiple primitive-sharing compositions as inputs and constrains the disentangled primitive features to be general across these compositions. More specifically, we leverage a compositional graph to define the overall primitive-sharing relationships between compositions, and build a task-specific architecture upon the recently successful large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) CLIP, with dual cross-composition disentangling adapters (called L-Adapter and V-Adapter) inserted into CLIP's frozen text and image encoders, respectively.

While early approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM, that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14 mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more robust chart reasoning in future research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, little is known about their performance in noise. This study therefore explores PTTM performance in types of noise likely to be encountered once deployed. Our analyses reveal PTTMs are highly sensitive to noise. Hold/shift accuracy drops from 84% in clean speech to just 52% in 10 dB music noise. Training with noisy data enables a multimodal PTTM, which includes visual features to better exploit visual cues, with 72% accuracy in 10 dB music noise. The multimodal PTTM outperforms the audio-only PTTM across all noise types and SNRs, highlighting its ability to exploit visual cues; however, this does not always generalise to new types of noise. Analysis also reveals that successful training relies on accurate transcription, limiting the use of ASR-derived transcriptions to clean conditions. We make code publicly available for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage, causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025.

Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions (84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns. This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for future work and make all code publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical image translation, Diffusion model, 16 pages</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few predefined conditioning settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. We also show more insights of our method by detailed ablation study and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, these approaches fail to replicate the diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.</p></details> | 49 pages, 33 figures | None |

Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models so as to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed on to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic crashes result in millions of deaths annually and significant economic burdens, particularly on Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Road safety assessments traditionally rely on human-labelled data, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced automated road safety assessments, they typically demand large labelled datasets and often require fine-tuning for each new geographic context. This study explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) with zero-shot capability can overcome these limitations to serve as effective road safety assessors using the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) standard. Our approach, V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), leverages advanced VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini, to analyse road safety attributes without requiring any labelled training data. By optimising prompt engineering and utilising crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, V-RoAst provides a scalable, cost-effective, and automated solution for global road safety assessments. Preliminary results show that while VLMs achieve lower performance than CNN-based models, they are capable of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and show potential in predicting star ratings from crowdsourced imagery. However, their performance is poor when key visual features are absent in the imagery, emphasising the need for human labelling to address these gaps. Advancements in VLMs, alongside in-context learning such as chain-of-thought and few-shot learning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, present opportunities for improvement, making VLMs promising tools for road assessment tasks. Designed for resource-constrained stakeholders, this framework holds the potential to save lives and reduce economic burdens worldwide.

Traditional methods often rely on object-space optimization, requiring intricate geometric descriptors and energy functions to handle complex shapes. In this paper, we introduce a versatile image-space collage technique. Leveraging a differentiable renderer, our method effectively optimizes the object layout with image-space losses, bringing the benefit of fixed complexity and easy accommodation of various shapes. Applying a hierarchical resolution strategy in image space, our method efficiently optimizes the collage with fast convergence, large coarse steps first and then small precise steps. The diverse visual expressiveness of our approach is demonstrated through various examples. Experimental results show that our method achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

| **[Cross-Modal Bidirectional Interaction Model for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08613v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Text, in contrast, provides a more expressive and human-friendly interpretable medium for understanding and analyzing model behavior. We propose a simple, yet powerful method for reformulating any pretrained visual classifier so that it can be queried with free-form text without compromising its original performance. Our approach is label-free, data and compute-efficient, and is trained to preserve the underlying classifiers distribution and decision-making processes. Our method unlocks several zero-shot text interpretability applications for any visual classifier. We apply our method on 40 visual classifiers and demonstrate two primary applications: 1) building both label-free and zero-shot concept bottleneck models and therefore converting any visual classifier to be inherently-interpretable and 2) zero-shot decoding of visual features into natural language sentences. In both tasks we establish new state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing works and surpassing CLIP-based baselines with ImageNet-only trained classifiers, while using up to 400x fewer images and 400,000x less text during training.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods typically align vision encoders with LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but this often deteriorates their ability to handle multiple languages as training progresses. We empirically observe that imbalanced SFT datasets, largely English-centric, degrade performance on non-English languages due to the failure in multilingual token alignment. To address this, we propose PARROT, a novel approach that leverages textual guidance for visual token alignment at the language level. PARROT conditions visual tokens on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align multilingual tokens. By computing cross-attention between initial visual features and textual embeddings, we select the most relevant experts, converting visual tokens into language-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), a new benchmark comprising 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, to assess multilingual capabilities.

When multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions, leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

To evaluate such attacks, the standard evaluation framework for such attacks relies on an evaluation model E, trained under the same task design as T. This framework has become the de facto standard for assessing progress in MI research, used across nearly all recent MI attacks and defenses without question. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of this MI evaluation framework. In particular, we identify a critical issue of this standard MI evaluation framework: Type-I adversarial examples. These are reconstructions that do not capture the visual features of private training data, yet are still deemed successful by the target model T and ultimately transferable to E. Such false positives undermine the reliability of the standard MI evaluation framework. To address this issue, we introduce a new MI evaluation framework that replaces the evaluation model E with advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By leveraging their general-purpose visual understanding, our MLLM-based framework does not depend on training of shared task design as in T, thus reducing Type-I transferability and providing more faithful assessments of reconstruction success. Using our MLLM-based evaluation framework, we reevaluate 26 diverse MI attack setups and empirically reveal consistently high false positive rates under the standard evaluation framework. Importantly, we demonstrate that many state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI methods report inflated attack accuracy, indicating that actual privacy leakage is significantly lower than previously believed. By uncovering this critical issue and proposing a robust solution, our work enables a reassessment of progress in MI research and sets a new standard for reliable and robust evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To su...</summary><p>To support future work, we release our MLLM-based MI evaluation framework and benchmarking suite at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosytuyen/mi-reconstruction-collection</p></details> | None |

While these tasks have traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and +7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO.

Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts.

In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object detection.

However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose challenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra information. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal interaction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral information (\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object keypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional text Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal alignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from text semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using learnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the identity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of concrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition module to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint prompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing the learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt learning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution. In addition, to adapt to small-scale multi-spectral data and mitigate style differences between spectra, we propose multi-spectral adapter that employs a low-rank adaption method to learn spectra-specific features. Comprehensive experiments on 5 benchmarks, including RGBNT201, Market-MM, MSVR310, RGBN300, and RGBNT100, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> | None |

Well alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model.

| **[VEAttack: Downstream-agnostic Vision Encoder Attack against Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17440v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns. While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity to attack steps.

| **[Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, while they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns, compromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes its encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers. To address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially designed feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the encoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded, thereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations and mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the attack success rate from 89.70\% to 2.76\% against the most advanced multimodal attacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring tuning a large number of parameters, the linear encoding approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives have focused on decomposing the linear mapping to spatial and feature components but focus on finding static receptive fields for units that are applicable only in early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable, without the need to create importance maps, by interpreting the attention routing signal for different high-level categorical areas. Our approach proposes a mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps can be routed based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.</p></details> |  | None |

We present a method that combines contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training to learn game-invariant visual features. By simultaneously encouraging similar content to cluster and discouraging game-specific cues via an adversarial domain classifier, our approach produces embeddings that generalize across diverse games. Experiments on the Bingsu game-image dataset (10,000 screenshots from 10 games) demonstrate that after only a few training epochs, our model's features no longer cluster by game, indicating successful invariance and potential for improved cross-game transfer (e.g., glitch detection) with minimal fine-tuning. This capability paves the way for more generalizable game vision models that require little to no retraining on new games.</p></details> |  | None |

Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

This paper presents a deep learning-based multi-modal framework, incorporating visual and tactile data, to predict perceptual texture ratings by leveraging multi-feature inputs. To achieve this, a four-dimensional haptic attribute space encompassing rough-smooth, flat-bumpy, sticky-slippery, and hard-soft dimensions is first constructed through psychophysical experiments, where participants evaluate 50 diverse real-world texture samples. A physical signal space is subsequently created by collecting visual and tactile data from these textures. Finally, a deep learning architecture integrating a CNN-based autoencoder for visual feature learning and a ConvLSTM network for tactile data processing is trained to predict user-assigned attribute ratings. This multi-modal, multi-feature approach maps physical signals to perceptual ratings, enabling accurate predictions for unseen textures. To evaluate predictive accuracy, we employed leave-one-out cross-validation to rigorously assess the model's reliability and generalizability against several machine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework consistently outperforms single-modality approaches, achieving lower MAE and RMSE, highlighting the efficacy of combining visual and tactile modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SCENIR: Visual Semantic Clarity through Unsupervised Scene Graph Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15867v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing studies are limited to coarse interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations, attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships. Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate neuro-decoding applications.

Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive, near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a demonstration.</p></details> |  | None |

Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing, leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar). Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a scene.

| **[Expanding Zero-Shot Object Counting with Rich Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15398v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown remarkable performance in various segmentation tasks, its application to RRSIS presents several challenges, including understanding the text-described RS scenes and generating effective prompts from text descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RS2-SAM 2, a novel framework that adapts SAM 2 to RRSIS by aligning the adapted RS features and textual features, providing pseudo-mask-based dense prompts, and enforcing boundary constraints. Specifically, we first employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. Then, we design a bidirectional hierarchical fusion module to adapt SAM 2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. Additionally, a mask prompt generator is introduced to take the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produce a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM 2. To further refine segmentation, we introduce a text-guided boundary loss to optimize segmentation boundaries by computing text-weighted gradient differences. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with the ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

RB-SCD captures 11 types of semantic changes across varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework, Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering.

Existing studies analyze sentiment based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features, enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro F1.

In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation.

Despite their potential, existing models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings, this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of 41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1 million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Identifying whether the robot is contacting rigid or soft materials is critical for the downstream manipulation policy to be safe, yet vision alone is often insufficient due to occlusion and limited viewpoints in this unstructured environment. To address this, we propose a multi-modal classification framework that fuses vibrotactile (audio) and visual inputs to identify the contact class: leaf, twig, trunk, or ambient. Our key insight is that contact-induced vibrations carry material-specific signals, making audio effective for detecting contact events and distinguishing material types, while visual features add complementary semantic cues that support more fine-grained classification. We collect training data using a hand-held sensor probe and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to a robot-mounted probe embodiment, achieving an F1 score of 0.82. These results underscore the potential of audio-visual learning for manipulation in unstructured, contact-rich environments.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR Workshop GMCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene. However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal components disentangled from visual features are more effective in distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world. Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different tasks in 4D scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMFusion: Semantic-Preserving Fusion of Multimodal Medical Images for Enhanced Clinical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12251v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal medical image fusion plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis by integrating complementary information from different modalities to enhance image readability and clinical applicability. However, existing methods mainly follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Surrogate Interpretable Graph for Random Decision Forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01988v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for such a high-stakes domain.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate (imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than $60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2.

However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation, we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space. This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm.

Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[One Image is Worth a Thousand Words: A Usability Preservable Text-Image Collaborative Erasing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11131v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

In this paper, a multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics. For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy, outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Just Functioning as a Hook for Two-Stage Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07516v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to localize target trajectories specified by natural language expressions in videos. Existing RMOT methods mainly follow two paradigms: one-stage strategies and two-stage ones. The former jointly trains tracking with referring but suffers from substantial computational overhead. Although the latter improves efficiency, it overlooks the inherent contextual aggregation capabilities of pre-trained visual backbones and takes a detour. Meanwhile, its fixed dual-tower architecture restricts compatibility with other visual / text backbones. To address these limitations, we propose JustHook, a novel hook-like framework for two-stage RMOT, which introduces two core components: (1) a Visual Feature Hook (VFH), enabling JustHook to extract context-rich local features directly from the original visual backbone like a hook; (2) a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD), which transforms the passive cosine similarity measurement between independent modalities into active contrastive learning within the combined feature space. The proposed JustHook not only leverages the capabilities of pre-trained models but also breaks free from the constraints of inherent modality alignment, achieving strong scalability. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2 demonstrate that JustHook outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse encoder combinations, achieving a notable 7.77\% HOTA improvement on Refer-KITTI-V2.

Given a partial observation of a scene, deep generative models could generate the unseen regions and therefore provide more context, which enhances the capability of robots to generalize across unseen environments. However, due to the visual artifacts in generated images and inefficient integration of multi-modal features in policy learning, this direction remains an open challenge. We introduce NVSPolicy, a generalizable language-conditioned policy learning method that couples an adaptive novel-view synthesis module with a hierarchical policy network. Given an input image, NVSPolicy dynamically selects an informative viewpoint and synthesizes an adaptive novel-view image to enrich the visual context. To mitigate the impact of the imperfect synthesized images, we adopt a cycle-consistent VAE mechanism that disentangles the visual features into the semantic feature and the remaining feature. The two features are then fed into the hierarchical policy network respectively: the semantic feature informs the high-level meta-skill selection, and the remaining feature guides low-level action estimation. Moreover, we propose several practical mechanisms to make the proposed method efficient. Extensive experiments on CALVIN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it achieves an average success rate of 90.4\% across all tasks, greatly outperforming the recent methods. Ablation studies confirm the significance of our adaptive novel-view synthesis paradigm. In addition, we evaluate NVSPolicy on a real-world robotic platform to demonstrate its practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies basically rely on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder. Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local information from low-level visual features and integrate global information from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are progressively incorporated into textual representations through a stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally, MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual information based on different combinations, as well as different elements within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.

This technology has the potential to enhance user experiences by allowing quick access to relevant content across diverse domains. Existing methods typically rely either on expensive manually labeled frame-level annotations, or on a large external dataset of videos for weak supervision through category information. To overcome this, we focus on unsupervised video highlight detection, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We propose a novel unsupervised approach which capitalizes on the premise that significant moments tend to recur across multiple videos of the similar category in both audio and visual modalities. Surprisingly, audio remains under-explored, especially in unsupervised algorithms, despite its potential to detect key moments. Through a clustering technique, we identify pseudo-categories of videos and compute audio pseudo-highlight scores for each video by measuring the similarities of audio features among audio clips of all the videos within each pseudo-category. Similarly, we also compute visual pseudo-highlight scores for each video using visual features. Then, we combine audio and visual pseudo-highlights to create the audio-visual pseudo ground-truth highlight of each video for training an audio-visual highlight detection network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method over prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

While vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks. Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Despite advances in tasks such as food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations.

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing methods primarily focus on optimizing visual representations, incorporating additional modalities and refining object-level information can significantly improve the quality of distilled datasets. In this work, we introduce two key enhancements to dataset distillation: caption-guided supervision and object-centric masking. To integrate textual information, we propose two strategies for leveraging caption features: the feature concatenation, where caption embeddings are fused with visual features at the classification stage, and caption matching, which introduces a caption-based alignment loss during training to ensure semantic coherence between real and synthetic data. Additionally, we apply segmentation masks to isolate target objects and remove background distractions, introducing two loss functions designed for object-centric learning: masked feature alignment loss and masked gradient matching loss. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that integrating caption-based guidance and object-centric masking enhances dataset distillation, leading to synthetic datasets that achieve superior performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Gaze estimation systems are important for a myriad of tasks such as driver distraction monitoring, exam proctoring, accessibility features in modern software, etc. However, these systems face challenges in real-world scenarios, partially due to the low resolution of in-the-wild images and partially due to insufficient modeling of head-eye interactions in current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This paper introduces DHECA-SuperGaze, a deep learning-based method that advances gaze prediction through super-resolution (SR) and a dual head-eye cross-attention (DHECA) module. Our dual-branch convolutional backbone processes eye and multiscale SR head images, while the proposed DHECA module enables bidirectional feature refinement between the extracted visual features through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified critical annotation errors in one of the most diverse and widely used gaze estimation datasets, Gaze360, and rectified the mislabeled data. Performance evaluation on Gaze360 and GFIE datasets demonstrates superior within-dataset performance of the proposed method, reducing angular error (AE) by 0.48{\deg} (Gaze360) and 2.95{\deg} (GFIE) in static configurations, and 0.59{\deg} (Gaze360) and 3.00{\deg} (GFIE) in temporal settings compared to prior SOTA methods. Cross-dataset testing shows improvements in AE of more than 1.53{\deg} (Gaze360) and 3.99{\deg} (GFIE) in both static and temporal settings, validating the robust generalization properties of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Existing encoder-decoder models only rely on visual features extracted from raw input images, which can limit the understanding of spatial structures and semantic relationships, often resulting in suboptimal text generation. To address this, we propose Anatomical Attention Alignment Network (A3Net), a framework that enhance visual-textual understanding by constructing hyper-visual representations. Our approach integrates a knowledge dictionary of anatomical structures with patch-level visual features, enabling the model to effectively associate image regions with their corresponding anatomical entities. This structured representation improves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports.

Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

However, current methods generally suffer from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks consistently.

Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method, termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities. Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we extend the application of CLIP to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings. These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects. We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance alignment.

| **[A Benchmark Dataset and a Framework for Urdu Multimodal Named Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05148v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing. Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further MNER research in low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Adaptive Contextual Embedding for Robust Far-View Borehole Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05008v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In controlled blasting operations, accurately detecting densely distributed tiny boreholes from far-view imagery is critical for operational safety and efficiency. However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small object scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual features of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates. Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even under challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary quarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline YOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic and complex industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Locality-aware Cross-modal Correspondence Learning for Dense Audio-Visual Events Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07967v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense-localization Audio-Visual Events (DAVE) aims to identify time boundaries and corresponding categories for events that are both audible and visible in a long video, where events may co-occur and exhibit varying durations. However, complex audio-visual scenes often involve asynchronization between modalities, making accurate localization challenging. Existing DAVE solutions extract audio and visual features through unimodal encoders, and fuse them via dense cross-modal interaction. However, independent unimodal encoding struggles to emphasize shared semantics between modalities without cross-modal guidance, while dense cross-modal attention may over-attend to semantically unrelated audio-visual features. To address these problems, we present LoCo, a Locality-aware cross-modal Correspondence learning framework for DAVE. LoCo leverages the local temporal continuity of audio-visual events as important guidance to filter irrelevant cross-modal signals and enhance cross-modal alignment throughout both unimodal and cross-modal encoding stages. i) Specifically, LoCo applies Local Correspondence Feature (LCF) Modulation to enforce unimodal encoders to focus on modality-shared semantics by modulating agreement between audio and visual features based on local cross-modal coherence. ii) To better aggregate cross-modal relevant features, we further customize Local Adaptive Cross-modal (LAC) Interaction, which dynamically adjusts attention regions in a data-driven manner. This adaptive mechanism focuses attention on local event boundaries and accommodates varying event durations. By incorporating LCF and LAC, LoCo provides solid performance gains and outperforms existing DAVE methods.</p></details> |  | None |

A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual grounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on verbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1) loss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with ego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to arbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach designed to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual semantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic Enhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene features and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we propose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to provide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context during model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding significantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with improvements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset and smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric 3D visual grounding. Our method also achieves 1st place and receives the Innovation Award in the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge Multi-view 3D Visual Grounding Track, validating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

We optimize the parameters of Bezier curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture, and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape deformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://threedle.github.io/wir3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://threedle.github.io/wir3d) |

Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025)</p></details> | None |

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complexity of medical data leads to confounders that are difficult to observe, so bias between images and questions is inevitable. Such cross-modal bias makes it challenging to infer medically meaningful answers. In this work, we propose a causal inference framework for the MedVQA task, which effectively eliminates the relative confounding effect between the image and the question to ensure the precision of the question-answering (QA) session. We are the first to introduce a novel causal graph structure that represents the interaction between visual and textual elements, explicitly capturing how different questions influence visual features. During optimization, we apply the mutual information to discover spurious correlations and propose a multi-variable resampling front-door adjustment method to eliminate the relative confounding effect, which aims to align features based on their true causal relevance to the question-answering task. In addition, we also introduce a prompt strategy that combines multiple prompt forms to improve the model's ability to understand complex medical data and answer accurately. Extensive experiments on three MedVQA datasets demonstrate that 1) our method significantly improves the accuracy of MedVQA, and 2) our method achieves true causal correlations in the face of complex medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TMI 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods typically recognize hands and interacting objects as distinct semantic categories based solely on visual features, or simply use hand predictions as auxiliary cues for object segmentation. Despite the promising progress achieved by these methods, they fail to adequately model the interactive relationships between hands and objects while ignoring the coupled physical relationships among object categories, ultimately constraining their segmentation performance. To make up for the shortcomings of existing methods, we propose a novel method called CaRe-Ego that achieves state-of-the-art performance by emphasizing the contact between hands and objects from two aspects. First, we introduce a Hand-guided Object Feature Enhancer (HOFE) to establish the hand-object interactive relationships to extract more contact-relevant and discriminative object features. Second, we design the Contact-centric Object Decoupling Strategy (CODS) to explicitly model and disentangle coupling relationships among object categories, thereby emphasizing contact-aware feature learning. Experiments on various in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that Care-Ego significantly outperforms existing methods with robust generalization capability.

While deep learning has advanced pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore, we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple pest detection benchmarks.

Database and Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05411v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting viewer attention in omnidirectional videos (ODVs) is crucial for enhancing user engagement in virtual and augmented reality applications. Although both audio and visual modalities are essential for saliency prediction in ODVs, the joint exploitation of these two modalities has been limited, primarily due to the absence of large-scale audio-visual saliency databases and comprehensive analyses. This paper comprehensively investigates audio-visual attention in ODVs from both subjective and objective perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce a new audio-visual saliency database for omnidirectional videos, termed AVS-ODV database, containing 162 ODVs and corresponding eye movement data collected from 60 subjects under three audio modes including mute, mono, and ambisonics. Based on the constructed AVS-ODV database, we perform an in-depth analysis of how audio influences visual attention in ODVs. To advance the research on audio-visual saliency prediction for ODVs, we further establish a new benchmark based on the AVS-ODV database by testing numerous state-of-the-art saliency models, including visual-only models and audio-visual models. In addition, given the limitations of current models, we propose an innovative omnidirectional audio-visual saliency prediction network (OmniAVS), which is built based on the U-Net architecture, and hierarchically fuses audio and visual features from the multimodal aligned embedding space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OmniAVS model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both ODV AVS prediction and traditional AVS predcition tasks. The AVS-ODV database and OmniAVS model will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability.

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples datasets.

Existing methods usually focus on implicitly modeling audio and visual features through weak labels, without mining semantic relationships for different modalities and explicit modeling of event temporal dependencies. This makes it difficult for the model to accurately parse event information for each segment under weak supervision, especially when high similarity between segmental modal features leads to ambiguous event boundaries. Hence, we propose a multimodal optimization framework, TeMTG, that combines text enhancement and multi-hop temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained multimodal models to generate modality-specific text embeddings, and fuse them with audio-visual features to enhance the semantic representation of these features. In addition, we introduce a multi-hop temporal graph neural network, which explicitly models the local temporal relationships between segments, capturing the temporal continuity of both short-term and long-range events.

CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches primarily focus on learning exclusively from video data but lack prior knowledge. Recent researches leverage large language models (LLMs) by utilizing text-based inputs which suffer severe information loss. To tackle these limitations single-modality methods face, we propose a novel Intention-Conditioned Vision-Language (ICVL) model in this study that fully leverages the rich semantic information of visual data and the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Considering intention as a high-level concept guiding the evolution of actions, we first propose to employ a vision-language model (VLM) to infer behavioral intentions as comprehensive textual features directly from video inputs. The inferred intentions are then fused with visual features through a multi-modality fusion strategy, resulting in intention-enhanced visual representations. These enhanced visual representations, along with textual prompts, are fed into LLM for future action anticipation. Furthermore, we propose an effective example selection strategy jointly considers visual and textual similarities, providing more relevant and informative examples for in-context learning. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA GAZE+ datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing attention-backed segmentation methods suffer from boundary instability and contextual discontinuities during feature mapping, our framework implements a higher-dimensional geometric smoothing method to establish a robust manifold relationships between visually coherent regions. GeloVec combines modified Chebyshev distance metrics with multispatial transformations to enhance segmentation accuracy through stabilized feature extraction. The core innovation lies in the adaptive sampling weights system that calculates geometric distances in n-dimensional feature space, achieving superior edge preservation while maintaining intra-class homogeneity. The multispatial transformation matrix incorporates tensorial projections with orthogonal basis vectors, creating more discriminative feature representations without sacrificing computational efficiency. Experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, with mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) gains of 2.1%, 2.7%, and 2.4% on Caltech Birds-200, LSDSC, and FSSD datasets respectively compared to state-of-the-art methods. GeloVec's mathematical foundation in Riemannian geometry provides theoretical guarantees on segmentation stability. Importantly, our framework maintains computational efficiency through parallelized implementation of geodesic transformations and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across disciplines due to the absence of information loss during transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Moreover, style noise, such as illumination and color contrast, reduces the identity discriminability and modality invariance of features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and Decoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different modalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant features within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian descriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality alignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we propose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which decomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related components, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the textual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter and the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian semantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided Feature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information for identification from the style-related features and restores it back into the pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the features after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with that between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DSFAD.</p></details> |  | None |

Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior, caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB) medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations.

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures | None |

While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[DGFNet: End-to-End Audio-Visual Source Separation Based on Dynamic Gating Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21366v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Audio-Visual Source Separation methods primarily adopt two design strategies. The first strategy involves fusing audio and visual features at the bottleneck layer of the encoder, followed by processing the fused features through the decoder. However, when there is a significant disparity between the two modalities, this approach may lead to the loss of critical information. The second strategy avoids direct fusion and instead relies on the decoder to handle the interaction between audio and visual features. Nonetheless, if the encoder fails to integrate information across modalities adequately, the decoder may be unable to effectively capture the complex relationships between them. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic fusion method based on a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the modality fusion degree. This approach mitigates the limitations of solely relying on the decoder and facilitates efficient collaboration between audio and visual features. Additionally, an audio attention module is introduced to enhance the expressive capacity of audio features, thereby further improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements on two benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness and advantages in Audio-Visual Source Separation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper (9 pages).

However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo.

Post training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning often struggles with overfitting to known concepts and may be overly reliant on memorized text features, limiting its adaptability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Federated Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on comprehensive contextual information -- image-conditioned features and textual attribute features of a class -- that is multimodal in nature. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through cross-attention, enabling richer contexual integration. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets spanning three generalization settings demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world scenarios often involve intricate multi-image inputs, leading to a notable performance decline as models struggle to disentangle critical information scattered across complex visual features. In this work, we propose Focus-Centric Visual Chain, a novel paradigm that enhances VLMs'perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities in multi-image scenarios. To facilitate this paradigm, we propose Focus-Centric Data Synthesis, a scalable bottom-up approach for synthesizing high-quality data with elaborate reasoning paths. Through this approach, We construct VISC-150K, a large-scale dataset with reasoning data in the form of Focus-Centric Visual Chain, specifically designed for multi-image tasks. Experimental results on seven multi-image benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves average performance gains of 3.16% and 2.24% across two distinct model architectures, without compromising the general vision-language capabilities. our study represents a significant step toward more robust and capable vision-language systems that can handle complex visual scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods fail to relocalize when faced with significantly different viewpoints. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map Alignment Anywhere), a global localization method capable of localizing in challenging and diverse environments by creating and aligning maps of open-set and view-invariant objects. ROMAN formulates and solves a registration problem between object submaps using a unified graph-theoretic global data association approach with a novel incorporation of a gravity direction prior and object shape and semantic similarity. This work's open-set object mapping and information-rich object association algorithm enables global localization, even in instances when maps are created from robots traveling in opposite directions. Through a set of challenging global localization experiments in indoor, urban, and unstructured/forested environments, we demonstrate that ROMAN achieves higher relative pose estimation accuracy than other image-based pose estimation methods or segment-based registration methods. Additionally, we evaluate ROMAN as a loop closure module in large-scale multi-robot SLAM and show a 35% improvement in trajectory estimation error compared to standard SLAM systems using visual features for loop closures.

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization.

While previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features. Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025, 11 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables,</p></details> | None |

HumMorph renders a human actor in any specified pose given a few observed views (starting from just one) in arbitrary poses. Our method enables fast inference as it relies only on feed-forward passes through the model. We first construct a coarse representation of the actor in the canonical T-pose, which combines visual features from individual partial observations and fills missing information using learned prior knowledge. The coarse representation is complemented by fine-grained pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the observed views, which provide high-resolution appearance information. We show that HumMorph is competitive with the state-of-the-art when only a single input view is available, however, we achieve results with significantly better visual quality given just 2 monocular observations. Moreover, previous generalized methods assume access to accurate body shape and pose parameters obtained using synchronized multi-camera setups. In contrast, we consider a more practical scenario where these body parameters are noisily estimated directly from the observed views. Our experimental results demonstrate that our architecture is more robust to errors in the noisy parameters and clearly outperforms the state of the art in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jakubzadrozny.github.io/hummorph</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jakubzadrozny.github.io/hummorph) |

With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios.

We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency. FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA) captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods.

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

This versatile OST is empowered by the hybrid pretraining to obtain perception priors and leveraged as the visual connector that bridges the 3D data to the LLM.

Currently, no research on talking portrait synthesis has considered this aspect. To address this, we propose a FREquency-modulated, high-fidelity, and real-time Audio-driven talKing portrait synthesis framework, named FREAK, which models talking portraits from the frequency domain perspective, enhancing the fidelity and naturalness of the synthesized portraits. FREAK introduces two novel frequency-based modules: 1) the Visual Encoding Frequency Modulator (VEFM) to couple multi-scale visual features in the frequency domain, better preserving visual frequency information and reducing the gap in the frequency spectrum between synthesized and natural frames. and 2) the Audio Visual Frequency Modulator (AVFM) to help the model learn the talking pattern in the frequency domain and improve audio-visual synchronization. Additionally, we optimize the model in both pixel domain and frequency domain jointly. Furthermore, FREAK supports seamless switching between one-shot and video dubbing settings, offering enhanced flexibility. Due to its superior performance, it can simultaneously support high-resolution video results and real-time inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method synthesizes high-fidelity talking portraits with detailed facial textures and precise lip synchronization in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Explainable AI: Multi-Modal Transformer for Video-based Image Description Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16788v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and analyzing video actions are essential for producing insightful and contextualized descriptions, especially for video-based applications like intelligent monitoring and autonomous systems. The proposed work introduces a novel framework for generating natural language descriptions from video datasets by combining textual and visual modalities. The suggested architecture makes use of ResNet50 to extract visual features from video frames that are taken from the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD), and Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) datasets. The extracted visual characteristics are converted into patch embeddings and then run through an encoder-decoder model based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2). In order to align textual and visual representations and guarantee high-quality description production, the system uses multi-head self-attention and cross-attention techniques. The model's efficacy is demonstrated by performance evaluation using BLEU (1-4), CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. The suggested framework outperforms traditional methods with BLEU-4 scores of 0.755 (BDD-X) and 0.778 (MSVD), CIDEr scores of 1.235 (BDD-X) and 1.315 (MSVD), METEOR scores of 0.312 (BDD-X) and 0.329 (MSVD), and ROUGE-L scores of 0.782 (BDD-X) and 0.795 (MSVD). By producing human-like, contextually relevant descriptions, strengthening interpretability, and improving real-world applications, this research advances explainable AI.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces a new image description generation model that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with cross-modal attention and a GPT-4-based transformer decoder. The ViT captures high-quality visual features from chest X-rays, which are fused with text data through cross-modal attention to improve the accuracy, context, and richness of image descriptions. The GPT-4 decoder transforms these fused features into accurate and relevant captions. The model was tested on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Indiana University (IU) Chest X-ray datasets. On the IU dataset, it achieved scores of 0.854 (B-1), 0.883 (CIDEr), 0.759 (METEOR), and 0.712 (ROUGE-L). On the NIH dataset, it achieved the best performance on all metrics: BLEU 1--4 (0.825, 0.788, 0.765, 0.752), CIDEr (0.857), METEOR (0.726), and ROUGE-L (0.705). This framework has the potential to enhance chest X-ray evaluation, assisting radiologists in more precise and efficient diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11074v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for advancing CL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PixelWeb: The First Web GUI Dataset with Pixel-Wise Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16419v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) datasets are crucial for various downstream tasks. However, GUI datasets often generate annotation information through automatic labeling, which commonly results in inaccurate GUI element BBox annotations, including missing, duplicate, or meaningless BBoxes. These issues can degrade the performance of models trained on these datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally, existing GUI datasets only provide BBox annotations visually, which restricts the development of visually related GUI downstream tasks. To address these issues, we introduce PixelWeb, a large-scale GUI dataset containing over 100,000 annotated web pages. PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that integrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure analysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis. Channel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of occlusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap annotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and stacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally, PixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and mask annotations. Manual verification by three independent annotators confirms the high quality and accuracy of PixelWeb annotations. Experimental results on GUI element detection tasks show that PixelWeb achieves performance on the mAP95 metric that is 3-7 times better than existing datasets. We believe that PixelWeb has great potential for performance improvement in downstream tasks such as GUI generation and automated user interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

| **[Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning for Multi-Task Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16145v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task visual grounding (MTVG) includes two sub-tasks, i.e., Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Segmentation (RES). The existing representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which mainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature extraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal interaction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks. Albeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two limitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the entire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction and it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship between REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the collaborative prediction for more accurate output. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning framework for multi-task visual grounding, called PLVL, which not only finely mine the inherent feature expression of the visual modality itself but also progressively inject the language information to help learn linguistic-related visual features. In this manner, our PLVL does not need additional cross-modal fusion module while fully introducing the language guidance. Furthermore, we analyze that the localization center for REC would help identify the to-be-segmented object region for RES to some extent. Inspired by this investigation, we design a multi-task head to accomplish collaborative predictions for these two sub-tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that our PLVL obviously outperforms the representative methods in both REC and RES tasks. https://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL) |

The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Beyond key video segment extraction from the raw laryngeal videos, MLVAS is able to generate effective audio and visual features for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. Pre-trained audio encoders are utilized to encode the patient voice to get the audio features. Visual features are generated by measuring the angle deviation of both the left and right vocal folds to the estimated glottal midline on the segmented glottis masks. To get better masks, we introduce a diffusion-based refinement that follows traditional U-Net segmentation to reduce false positives. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and modalities in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, unilateral VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | Submitted to CSL | None |

Despite extensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial gaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive rationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive interpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present Chimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework to derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental drivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and affective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional responses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first incorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it extracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation) and fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates them into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic). Finally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a large language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues evoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental results on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as GPT-4o.

A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EmoSEM: Segment and Explain Emotion Stimuli in Visual Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14658v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on a key challenge in visual art understanding: given an art image, the model pinpoints pixel regions that trigger a specific human emotion, and generates linguistic explanations for the emotional arousal. Despite recent advances in art understanding, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual challenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion makes it difficult for general segmentation models like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second, the abstract nature of art expression makes it difficult for captioning models to balance pixel-level semantic understanding and emotion reasoning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the segmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with the language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain semantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. The method innovatively realizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level emotion interpretation, providing the first interpretable fine-grained analysis framework for artistic emotion computing. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous works address this challenge by utilizing Vision-Language Models and mask proposal networks for region-text matching. However, this paradigm may lead to incorrect target localization due to the inherent ambiguity and diversity of free-form referring expressions. To alleviate this issue, we present LGD (Leveraging Generative Descriptions), a framework that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models to enhance region-text matching performance in Vision-Language Models. Specifically, we first design two kinds of prompts, the attribute prompt and the surrounding prompt, to guide the Multi-Modal Large Language Models in generating descriptions related to the crucial attributes of the referent object and the details of surrounding objects, referred to as attribute description and surrounding description, respectively. Secondly, three visual-text matching scores are introduced to evaluate the similarity between instance-level visual features and textual features, which determines the mask most associated with the referring expression. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, with maximum improvements of 9.97% in oIoU and 11.29% in mIoU compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our experimental results demonstrate that ResNetVLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot video understanding (ZSVU) on several benchmarks, including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, TGIF-QA FrameQA, and ActivityNet-QA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional attention mechanisms, despite notable benchmarks, are hindered by quadratic complexity, limiting their ability to fully capture global contextual dependencies and rich semantic information in both modalities. To address this limitation, we introduce DualKanbaFormer, a novel framework that leverages parallel Textual and Visual KanbaFormer modules for robust multimodal analysis. Our approach incorporates Aspect-Driven Sparse Attention (ADSA) to dynamically balance coarse-grained aggregation and fine-grained selection for aspect-focused precision, ensuring the preservation of both global context awareness and local precision in textual and visual representations. Additionally, we utilize the Selective State Space Model (Mamba) to capture extensive global semantic information across both modalities. Furthermore, We replace traditional feed-forward networks and normalization with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Dynamic Tanh (DyT) to enhance non-linear expressivity and inference stability. To facilitate the effective integration of textual and visual features, we design a multimodal gated fusion layer that dynamically optimizes inter-modality interactions, significantly enhancing the models efficacy in MABSA tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets reveal that DualKanbaFormer consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, conventional lesion segmentation models lack the flexibility to distinguish lesions according to specific requirements. Given the practical advantages of using text as guidance, we propose a novel model, Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor (LSMS), which segments target lesions in medical images based on given textual expressions. We define this as a new task termed Referring Lesion Segmentation (RLS). To address the lack of suitable benchmarks for RLS, we construct a vision-language medical dataset named Reference Hepatic Lesion Segmentation (RefHL-Seg). LSMS incorporates two key designs: (i) Scale-Aware Vision-Language attention module, which performs visual feature extraction and vision-language alignment in parallel. By leveraging diverse convolutional kernels, this module acquires rich visual representations and interacts closely with linguistic features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for precise object localization. (ii) Full-Scale Decoder, which globally models multi-modal features across multiple scales and captures complementary information between them to accurately delineate lesion boundaries. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function comprising both segmentation loss and vision-language contrastive loss to better optimize cross-modal learning. We validate the performance of LSMS on RLS as well as on conventional lesion segmentation tasks across multiple datasets. Our LSMS consistently achieves superior performance with significantly lower computational cost. Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although the vMF distribution is widely employed in a variety of probabilistic learning tasks involving spherical data, principled tools for comparing vMF distributions remain limited, primarily due to the intractability of normalization constants and the absence of suitable geometric metrics. Motivated by the theory of optimal transport, we propose a Wasserstein-like distance that decomposes the discrepancy between two vMF distributions into two interpretable components: a geodesic term capturing the angular separation between mean directions, and a variance-like term quantifying differences in concentration parameters. The derivation leverages a Gaussian approximation in the high-concentration regime to yield a tractable, closed-form expression that respects the intrinsic spherical geometry. We show that the proposed distance exhibits desirable theoretical properties and induces a latent geometric structure on the space of non-degenerate vMF distributions. As a primary application, we develop the efficient algorithms for vMF mixture reduction, enabling structure-preserving compression of mixture models in high-dimensional settings. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and real-world high-dimensional embeddings, including biomedical sentence representations and deep visual features, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed geometry in distinguishing distributions and supporting interpretable inference. This work expands the statistical toolbox for directional data analysis by introducing a tractable, transport-inspired distance tailored to the geometry of the hypersphere.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnomalyControl: Learning Cross-modal Semantic Features for Controllable Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06510v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Traditional CIL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, VLMs show promising potential for enhancing CIL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and integrating multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Calibration Enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) framework. Specifically, FCPS introduces a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism that iteratively calibrates the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thus preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, parameter integration enables effective knowledge transfer, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[QMix: Quality-aware Learning with Mixed Noise for Robust Retinal Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05169v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the complexity of medical image acquisition and the difficulty of annotation, medical image datasets inevitably contain noise. Noisy data with wrong labels affects the robustness and generalization ability of deep neural networks. Previous noise learning methods mainly considered noise arising from images being mislabeled, i.e. label noise, assuming that all mislabeled images are of high image quality. However, medical images are prone to suffering extreme quality issues, i.e. data noise, where discriminative visual features are missing for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a noise learning framework, termed as QMix, that learns a robust disease diagnosis model under mixed noise. QMix alternates between sample separation and quality-aware semisupervised training in each training epoch. In the sample separation phase, we design a joint uncertainty-loss criterion to effectively separate (1) correctly labeled images; (2) mislabeled images with high quality and (3) mislabeled images with low quality. In the semi-supervised training phase, we train a disease diagnosis model to learn robust feature representation from the separated samples. Specifically, we devise a sample-reweighing loss to mitigate the effect of mislabeled images with low quality during training. Meanwhile, a contrastive enhancement loss is proposed to further distinguish mislabeled images with low quality from correctly labeled images. QMix achieved state-of-the-art disease diagnosis performance on five public retinal image datasets and exhibited substantial improvement on robustness against mixed noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in large multi-modal models, notably Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have motivated researchers to incorporate CLIP into dual-stream-based VQA methods. This integration aims to harness the model's superior semantic understanding capabilities to replicate the object recognition and detail analysis in ventral stream, as well as spatial relationship analysis in dorsal stream. However, CLIP is originally designed for images and lacks the ability to capture temporal and motion information inherent in videos.To address the limitation, this paper propose a Decoupled Vision-Language Modeling with Text-Guided Adaptation for Blind Video Quality Assessment (DVLTA-VQA), which decouples CLIP's visual and textual components, and integrates them into different stages of the NR-VQA pipeline. Specifically, a Video-Based Temporal CLIP module is proposed to explicitly model temporal dynamics and enhance motion perception, aligning with the dorsal stream. Additionally, a Temporal Context Module is developed to refine inter-frame dependencies, further improving motion modeling. On the ventral stream side, a Basic Visual Feature Extraction Module is employed to strengthen detail analysis. Finally, a text-guided adaptive fusion strategy is proposed to enable dynamic weighting of features, facilitating more effective integration of spatial and temporal information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAM-Based Building Change Detection with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12619v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet.

The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects.

Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images, with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e., the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder (LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C).

| **[Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11936v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter) |

Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

| **[Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11496v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures | None |

In computer vision, IVD has become an emerging task that leverages video from surveillance cameras and audio from remote microphones to localize and classify vehicles in each frame as moving, idling, or engine-off. As with other cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence between audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide complementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio conveys engine activity beyond the visual field. The previous end-to-end model, which uses a basic attention mechanism, struggles to align these modalities effectively, often missing vehicle detections. To address this issue, we propose AVIVDNetv2, a transformer-based end-to-end detection network. It incorporates a cross-modal transformer with global patch-level learning, a multiscale visual feature fusion module, and decoupled detection heads. Extensive experiments show that AVIVDNetv2 improves mAP by 7.66 over the disjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline, with consistent AP gains across all vehicle categories. Furthermore, AVIVDNetv2 outperforms the state-of-the-art method for sounding object localization, establishing a new performance benchmark on the AVIVD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the lack of high-quality datasets and the high cost of pixel annotation greatly limit the development of them. Considering the well-performed few-shot learning methods for downstream tasks, we investigate the application of the few-shot learning method to scene text segmentation. We propose TSAL, which leverages CLIP's prior knowledge to learn text attributes for segmentation. To fully utilize the semantic and texture information in the image, a visual-guided branch is proposed to separately extract text and background features. To reduce data dependency and improve text detection accuracy, the adaptive prompt-guided branch employs effective adaptive prompt templates to capture various text attributes. To enable adaptive prompts capture distinctive text features and complex background distribution, we propose Adaptive Feature Alignment module(AFA). By aligning learnable tokens of different attributes with visual features and prompt prototypes, AFA enables adaptive prompts to capture both general and distinctive attribute information. TSAL can capture the unique attributes of text and achieve precise segmentation using only few images. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on multiple text segmentation datasets under few-shot settings and show great potential in text-related domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification. Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions, accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p></details> |  | None |

The recently developed text-guided SR approaches leverage textual descriptions to enhance their detail restoration capabilities but frequently struggle with effectively performing alignment, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal semantic enhancement framework that integrates textual semantics with visual features, effectively mitigating semantic mismatches and detail losses in highly degraded low-resolution (LR) images. Our method enables realistic, high-quality SR to be performed at large upscaling factors, with a maximum scaling ratio of 16$\times$. The framework integrates both text and image inputs using the prompt predictor, the Text-Image Fusion Block (TIFBlock), and the Iterative Refinement Module, leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features to guide a progressive enhancement process with fine-grained alignment. This synergy produces high-resolution outputs with sharp textures and strong semantic coherence, even at substantial scaling factors. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, by leveraging textual semantics, our method offers a degree of super-resolution editability, allowing for controlled enhancements while preserving semantic consistency.

However, the exploration of multimodal facial representation for understanding perception has been limited. Understanding and analyzing facial states, such as Action Units (AUs) and emotions, require a comprehensive and robust framework that bridges visual and linguistic modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive pipeline for multimodal facial state analysis. First, we compile a new Multimodal Face Dataset (MFA) by generating detailed multilevel language descriptions of face, incorporating Action Unit (AU) and emotion descriptions, by leveraging GPT-4o. Second, we introduce a novel Multilevel Multimodal Face Foundation model (MF^2) tailored for Action Unit (AU) and emotion recognition. Our model incorporates comprehensive visual feature modeling at both local and global levels of face image, enhancing its ability to represent detailed facial appearances. This design aligns visual representations with structured AU and emotion descriptions, ensuring effective cross-modal integration. Third, we develop a Decoupled Fine-Tuning Network (DFN) that efficiently adapts MF^2 across various tasks and datasets. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also broadens the applicability of the foundation model to diverse scenarios.

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during LLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the entire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens.

However, existing works are primarily limited to single-subject oriented text-to-video generation, leaving the more challenging problem of customized multi-subject generation unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel VideoDreamer framework, which can generate temporally consistent text-guided videos that faithfully preserve the visual features of the given multiple subjects. Specifically, VideoDreamer adopts the pretrained Stable Diffusion with temporal modules as its base video generator, taking the power of the text-to-image model to generate diversified content. The video generator is further customized for multi-subjects, which leverages the proposed Disen-Mix Finetuning and Human-in-the-Loop Re-finetuning strategy, to tackle the attribute binding problem of multi-subject generation. Additionally, we present a disentangled motion customization strategy to finetune the temporal modules so that we can generate videos with both customized subjects and motions. To evaluate the performance of customized multi-subject text-to-video generation, we introduce the MultiStudioBench benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of VideoDreamer to generate videos with new content such as new events and backgrounds, tailored to the customized multiple subjects.</p></details> |  | None |

While such a feature learning scheme achieves promising performance, learning discriminative features solely based on visual information is challenging especially in case of environmental interference such as occlusion, blur and domain variance. In this work, we argue that multi-modal language-driven features provide complementary information to classical visual features, thereby aiding in improving the robustness to such environmental interference. To this end, we propose a new multi-object tracking framework, named LG-MOT, that explicitly leverages language information at different levels of granularity (scene-and instance-level) and combines it with standard visual features to obtain discriminative representations. To develop LG-MOT, we annotate existing MOT datasets with scene-and instance-level language descriptions. We then encode both instance-and scene-level language information into high-dimensional embeddings, which are utilized to guide the visual features during training. At inference, our LG-MOT uses the standard visual features without relying on annotated language descriptions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, MOT17, DanceTrack and SportsMOT, reveal the merits of the proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance. On the DanceTrack test set, our LG-MOT achieves an absolute gain of 2.2\% in terms of target object association (IDF1 score), compared to the baseline using only visual features. Further, our LG-MOT exhibits strong cross-domain generalizability.

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures.

This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PMNI: Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration for Reflective and Textureless Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08410v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reflective and textureless surfaces remain a challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction.Both camera pose calibration and shape reconstruction often fail due to insufficient or unreliable cross-view visual features. To address these issues, we present PMNI (Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration), a neural surface reconstruction method that incorporates rich geometric information by leveraging surface normal maps instead of RGB images. By enforcing geometric constraints from surface normals and multi-view shape consistency within a neural signed distance function (SDF) optimization framework, PMNI simultaneously recovers accurate camera poses and high-fidelity surface geometry. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of reflective surfaces, even without reliable initial camera poses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FocalLens: Instruction Tuning Enables Zero-Shot Conditional Image Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08368v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual understanding is inherently contextual -- what we focus on in an image depends on the task at hand. For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19346v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.
