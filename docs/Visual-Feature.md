| **[LLaDA-V: Large Language Diffusion Models with Visual Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16933v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

| **[Estimating Perceptual Attributes of Haptic Textures Using Visuo-Tactile Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16352v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of perceptual attributes of haptic textures is essential for advancing VR and AR applications and enhancing robotic interaction with physical surfaces. This paper presents a deep learning-based multi-modal framework, incorporating visual and tactile data, to predict perceptual texture ratings by leveraging multi-feature inputs. To achieve this, a four-dimensional haptic attribute space encompassing rough-smooth, flat-bumpy, sticky-slippery, and hard-soft dimensions is first constructed through psychophysical experiments, where participants evaluate 50 diverse real-world texture samples. A physical signal space is subsequently created by collecting visual and tactile data from these textures. Finally, a deep learning architecture integrating a CNN-based autoencoder for visual feature learning and a ConvLSTM network for tactile data processing is trained to predict user-assigned attribute ratings. This multi-modal, multi-feature approach maps physical signals to perceptual ratings, enabling accurate predictions for unseen textures. To evaluate predictive accuracy, we employed leave-one-out cross-validation to rigorously assess the model's reliability and generalizability against several machine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework consistently outperforms single-modality approaches, achieving lower MAE and RMSE, highlighting the efficacy of combining visual and tactile modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SCENIR: Visual Semantic Clarity through Unsupervised Scene Graph Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15867v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring The Visual Feature Space for Multimodal Neural Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15755v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations, attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships. Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate neuro-decoding applications.

| **[VP Lab: a PEFT-Enabled Visual Prompting Laboratory for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15592v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks, including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive, near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a demonstration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Visual Question Answering on Multiple Remote Sensing Image Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15401v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extraction of visual features is an essential step in Visual Question Answering (VQA). Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing, leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar). Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a scene. The dataset and code are available at https://tammi.sylvainlobry.com/.</p></details> | <details><summary>EARTH...</summary><p>EARTHVISION 2025 8 pages, 1 page of supplementary material, 4 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Expanding Zero-Shot Object Counting with Rich Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15398v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AuxDet: Auxiliary Metadata Matters for Omni-Domain Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15184v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems, varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

| **[SpikeCLIP: A Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained Spiking Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06488v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

| **[Customized SAM 2 for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07266v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) aims to segment target objects in remote sensing (RS) images based on textual descriptions. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown remarkable performance in various segmentation tasks, its application to RRSIS presents several challenges, including understanding the text-described RS scenes and generating effective prompts from text descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RS2-SAM 2, a novel framework that adapts SAM 2 to RRSIS by aligning the adapted RS features and textual features, providing pseudo-mask-based dense prompts, and enforcing boundary constraints. Specifically, we first employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. Then, we design a bidirectional hierarchical fusion module to adapt SAM 2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. Additionally, a mask prompt generator is introduced to take the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produce a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM 2. To further refine segmentation, we introduce a text-guided boundary loss to optimize segmentation boundaries by computing text-weighted gradient differences. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unforgettable Lessons from Forgettable Images: Intra-Class Memorability Matters in Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20761v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with the ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach. Our code, pretrained models and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/Inspire.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://Koorye.github.io/proj) |

However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic change information due to the lack of high-quality annotated datasets in traffic scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from diverse cities and countries. RB-SCD captures 11 types of semantic changes across varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework, Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering. Experimental results on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies analyze sentiment based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features, enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RevCD -- Reversed Conditional Diffusion for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00511v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), we aim to recognize both seen and unseen categories using a model trained only on seen categories. In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation.

Despite their potential, existing models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings, this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of 41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1 million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Audio-Visual Contact Classification for Tree Structures in Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12665v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-rich manipulation tasks in agriculture, such as pruning and harvesting, require robots to physically interact with tree structures to maneuver through cluttered foliage. Identifying whether the robot is contacting rigid or soft materials is critical for the downstream manipulation policy to be safe, yet vision alone is often insufficient due to occlusion and limited viewpoints in this unstructured environment. To address this, we propose a multi-modal classification framework that fuses vibrotactile (audio) and visual inputs to identify the contact class: leaf, twig, trunk, or ambient. Our key insight is that contact-induced vibrations carry material-specific signals, making audio effective for detecting contact events and distinguishing material types, while visual features add complementary semantic cues that support more fine-grained classification. We collect training data using a hand-held sensor probe and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to a robot-mounted probe embodiment, achieving an F1 score of 0.82. These results underscore the potential of audio-visual learning for manipulation in unstructured, contact-rich environments.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR Workshop GMCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene. However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal components disentangled from visual features are more effective in distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world. Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different tasks in 4D scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods mainly follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate (imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than $60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2.

However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation, we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space. This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm.

Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment.

However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

In this paper, a multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics. For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy, outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Just Functioning as a Hook for Two-Stage Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07516v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to localize target trajectories specified by natural language expressions in videos. Existing RMOT methods mainly follow two paradigms: one-stage strategies and two-stage ones. The former jointly trains tracking with referring but suffers from substantial computational overhead. Although the latter improves efficiency, it overlooks the inherent contextual aggregation capabilities of pre-trained visual backbones and takes a detour. Meanwhile, its fixed dual-tower architecture restricts compatibility with other visual / text backbones. To address these limitations, we propose JustHook, a novel hook-like framework for two-stage RMOT, which introduces two core components: (1) a Visual Feature Hook (VFH), enabling JustHook to extract context-rich local features directly from the original visual backbone like a hook; (2) a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD), which transforms the passive cosine similarity measurement between independent modalities into active contrastive learning within the combined feature space. The proposed JustHook not only leverages the capabilities of pre-trained models but also breaks free from the constraints of inherent modality alignment, achieving strong scalability. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2 demonstrate that JustHook outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse encoder combinations, achieving a notable 7.77\% HOTA improvement on Refer-KITTI-V2. Code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Given a partial observation of a scene, deep generative models could generate the unseen regions and therefore provide more context, which enhances the capability of robots to generalize across unseen environments. However, due to the visual artifacts in generated images and inefficient integration of multi-modal features in policy learning, this direction remains an open challenge. We introduce NVSPolicy, a generalizable language-conditioned policy learning method that couples an adaptive novel-view synthesis module with a hierarchical policy network. Given an input image, NVSPolicy dynamically selects an informative viewpoint and synthesizes an adaptive novel-view image to enrich the visual context. To mitigate the impact of the imperfect synthesized images, we adopt a cycle-consistent VAE mechanism that disentangles the visual features into the semantic feature and the remaining feature. The two features are then fed into the hierarchical policy network respectively: the semantic feature informs the high-level meta-skill selection, and the remaining feature guides low-level action estimation. Moreover, we propose several practical mechanisms to make the proposed method efficient. Extensive experiments on CALVIN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it achieves an average success rate of 90.4\% across all tasks, greatly outperforming the recent methods. Ablation studies confirm the significance of our adaptive novel-view synthesis paradigm. In addition, we evaluate NVSPolicy on a real-world robotic platform to demonstrate its practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing studies basically rely on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder. Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local information from low-level visual features and integrate global information from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are progressively incorporated into textual representations through a stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally, MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual information based on different combinations, as well as different elements within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.

This technology has the potential to enhance user experiences by allowing quick access to relevant content across diverse domains. Existing methods typically rely either on expensive manually labeled frame-level annotations, or on a large external dataset of videos for weak supervision through category information. To overcome this, we focus on unsupervised video highlight detection, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We propose a novel unsupervised approach which capitalizes on the premise that significant moments tend to recur across multiple videos of the similar category in both audio and visual modalities. Surprisingly, audio remains under-explored, especially in unsupervised algorithms, despite its potential to detect key moments. Through a clustering technique, we identify pseudo-categories of videos and compute audio pseudo-highlight scores for each video by measuring the similarities of audio features among audio clips of all the videos within each pseudo-category. Similarly, we also compute visual pseudo-highlight scores for each video using visual features. Then, we combine audio and visual pseudo-highlights to create the audio-visual pseudo ground-truth highlight of each video for training an audio-visual highlight detection network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method over prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

While vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks. Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Despite advances in tasks such as food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations. To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation. https://huiyanqi.github.io/fastfood-nutrition-estimation/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://huiyanqi.github.io/fastfood-nutrition-estimation) |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Multi-Modal Information to Enhance Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08605v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to create a compact and highly representative synthetic dataset that preserves the knowledge of a larger real dataset. While existing methods primarily focus on optimizing visual representations, incorporating additional modalities and refining object-level information can significantly improve the quality of distilled datasets. In this work, we introduce two key enhancements to dataset distillation: caption-guided supervision and object-centric masking. To integrate textual information, we propose two strategies for leveraging caption features: the feature concatenation, where caption embeddings are fused with visual features at the classification stage, and caption matching, which introduces a caption-based alignment loss during training to ensure semantic coherence between real and synthetic data. Additionally, we apply segmentation masks to isolate target objects and remove background distractions, introducing two loss functions designed for object-centric learning: masked feature alignment loss and masked gradient matching loss. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that integrating caption-based guidance and object-centric masking enhances dataset distillation, leading to synthetic datasets that achieve superior performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Gaze estimation systems are important for a myriad of tasks such as driver distraction monitoring, exam proctoring, accessibility features in modern software, etc. However, these systems face challenges in real-world scenarios, partially due to the low resolution of in-the-wild images and partially due to insufficient modeling of head-eye interactions in current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This paper introduces DHECA-SuperGaze, a deep learning-based method that advances gaze prediction through super-resolution (SR) and a dual head-eye cross-attention (DHECA) module. Our dual-branch convolutional backbone processes eye and multiscale SR head images, while the proposed DHECA module enables bidirectional feature refinement between the extracted visual features through cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified critical annotation errors in one of the most diverse and widely used gaze estimation datasets, Gaze360, and rectified the mislabeled data. Performance evaluation on Gaze360 and GFIE datasets demonstrates superior within-dataset performance of the proposed method, reducing angular error (AE) by 0.48{\deg} (Gaze360) and 2.95{\deg} (GFIE) in static configurations, and 0.59{\deg} (Gaze360) and 3.00{\deg} (GFIE) in temporal settings compared to prior SOTA methods. Cross-dataset testing shows improvements in AE of more than 1.53{\deg} (Gaze360) and 3.99{\deg} (GFIE) in both static and temporal settings, validating the robust generalization properties of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP: Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy for Visuomotor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07819v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

| **[Anatomical Attention Alignment representation for Radiology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07689v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Radiology report generation (RRG) aims at producing detailed descriptions of medical images, reducing radiologists' workload and improving access to high-quality diagnostic services. Existing encoder-decoder models only rely on visual features extracted from raw input images, which can limit the understanding of spatial structures and semantic relationships, often resulting in suboptimal text generation. To address this, we propose Anatomical Attention Alignment Network (A3Net), a framework that enhance visual-textual understanding by constructing hyper-visual representations. Our approach integrates a knowledge dictionary of anatomical structures with patch-level visual features, enabling the model to effectively associate image regions with their corresponding anatomical entities. This structured representation improves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports. Experimental results on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that A3Net significantly improves both visual perception and text generation quality.

Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2025</p></details> | None |

However, current methods generally suffer from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks consistently.

Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method, termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities. Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we extend the application of CLIP to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings. These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects. We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance alignment.

However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small object scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual features of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates. Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even under challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary quarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline YOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic and complex industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Locality-aware Cross-modal Correspondence Learning for Dense Audio-Visual Events Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07967v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense-localization Audio-Visual Events (DAVE) aims to identify time boundaries and corresponding categories for events that are both audible and visible in a long video, where events may co-occur and exhibit varying durations. However, complex audio-visual scenes often involve asynchronization between modalities, making accurate localization challenging. Existing DAVE solutions extract audio and visual features through unimodal encoders, and fuse them via dense cross-modal interaction. However, independent unimodal encoding struggles to emphasize shared semantics between modalities without cross-modal guidance, while dense cross-modal attention may over-attend to semantically unrelated audio-visual features. To address these problems, we present LoCo, a Locality-aware cross-modal Correspondence learning framework for DAVE. LoCo leverages the local temporal continuity of audio-visual events as important guidance to filter irrelevant cross-modal signals and enhance cross-modal alignment throughout both unimodal and cross-modal encoding stages. i) Specifically, LoCo applies Local Correspondence Feature (LCF) Modulation to enforce unimodal encoders to focus on modality-shared semantics by modulating agreement between audio and visual features based on local cross-modal coherence. ii) To better aggregate cross-modal relevant features, we further customize Local Adaptive Cross-modal (LAC) Interaction, which dynamically adjusts attention regions in a data-driven manner. This adaptive mechanism focuses attention on local event boundaries and accommodates varying event durations. By incorporating LCF and LAC, LoCo provides solid performance gains and outperforms existing DAVE methods.</p></details> |  | None |

A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual grounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on verbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1) loss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with ego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to arbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach designed to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual semantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic Enhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene features and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we propose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to provide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context during model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding significantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with improvements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset and smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric 3D visual grounding.

We leverage the intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture, and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape deformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://threedle.github.io/wir3d/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://threedle.github.io/wir3d) |

Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025)</p></details> | None |

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods.

However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complexity of medical data leads to confounders that are difficult to observe, so bias between images and questions is inevitable. Such cross-modal bias makes it challenging to infer medically meaningful answers. In this work, we propose a causal inference framework for the MedVQA task, which effectively eliminates the relative confounding effect between the image and the question to ensure the precision of the question-answering (QA) session. We are the first to introduce a novel causal graph structure that represents the interaction between visual and textual elements, explicitly capturing how different questions influence visual features. During optimization, we apply the mutual information to discover spurious correlations and propose a multi-variable resampling front-door adjustment method to eliminate the relative confounding effect, which aims to align features based on their true causal relevance to the question-answering task. In addition, we also introduce a prompt strategy that combines multiple prompt forms to improve the model's ability to understand complex medical data and answer accurately. Extensive experiments on three MedVQA datasets demonstrate that 1) our method significantly improves the accuracy of MedVQA, and 2) our method achieves true causal correlations in the face of complex medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TMI 2025</p></details> | None |

Previous methods typically recognize hands and interacting objects as distinct semantic categories based solely on visual features, or simply use hand predictions as auxiliary cues for object segmentation. Despite the promising progress achieved by these methods, they fail to adequately model the interactive relationships between hands and objects while ignoring the coupled physical relationships among object categories, ultimately constraining their segmentation performance. To make up for the shortcomings of existing methods, we propose a novel method called CaRe-Ego that achieves state-of-the-art performance by emphasizing the contact between hands and objects from two aspects. First, we introduce a Hand-guided Object Feature Enhancer (HOFE) to establish the hand-object interactive relationships to extract more contact-relevant and discriminative object features. Second, we design the Contact-centric Object Decoupling Strategy (CODS) to explicitly model and disentangle coupling relationships among object categories, thereby emphasizing contact-aware feature learning. Experiments on various in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that Care-Ego significantly outperforms existing methods with robust generalization capability.

While deep learning has advanced pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore, we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple pest detection benchmarks.

Database and Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05411v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting viewer attention in omnidirectional videos (ODVs) is crucial for enhancing user engagement in virtual and augmented reality applications. Although both audio and visual modalities are essential for saliency prediction in ODVs, the joint exploitation of these two modalities has been limited, primarily due to the absence of large-scale audio-visual saliency databases and comprehensive analyses. This paper comprehensively investigates audio-visual attention in ODVs from both subjective and objective perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce a new audio-visual saliency database for omnidirectional videos, termed AVS-ODV database, containing 162 ODVs and corresponding eye movement data collected from 60 subjects under three audio modes including mute, mono, and ambisonics. Based on the constructed AVS-ODV database, we perform an in-depth analysis of how audio influences visual attention in ODVs. To advance the research on audio-visual saliency prediction for ODVs, we further establish a new benchmark based on the AVS-ODV database by testing numerous state-of-the-art saliency models, including visual-only models and audio-visual models. In addition, given the limitations of current models, we propose an innovative omnidirectional audio-visual saliency prediction network (OmniAVS), which is built based on the U-Net architecture, and hierarchically fuses audio and visual features from the multimodal aligned embedding space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OmniAVS model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both ODV AVS prediction and traditional AVS predcition tasks. The AVS-ODV database and OmniAVS model will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability.

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page : https://shubhendu-jena.github.io/SparSplat/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://shubhendu-jena.github.io/SparSplat) |

Existing methods usually focus on implicitly modeling audio and visual features through weak labels, without mining semantic relationships for different modalities and explicit modeling of event temporal dependencies. This makes it difficult for the model to accurately parse event information for each segment under weak supervision, especially when high similarity between segmental modal features leads to ambiguous event boundaries. Hence, we propose a multimodal optimization framework, TeMTG, that combines text enhancement and multi-hop temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained multimodal models to generate modality-specific text embeddings, and fuse them with audio-visual features to enhance the semantic representation of these features. In addition, we introduce a multi-hop temporal graph neural network, which explicitly models the local temporal relationships between segments, capturing the temporal continuity of both short-term and long-range events. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators in the LLP dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292v4)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches primarily focus on learning exclusively from video data but lack prior knowledge. Recent researches leverage large language models (LLMs) by utilizing text-based inputs which suffer severe information loss. To tackle these limitations single-modality methods face, we propose a novel Intention-Conditioned Vision-Language (ICVL) model in this study that fully leverages the rich semantic information of visual data and the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Considering intention as a high-level concept guiding the evolution of actions, we first propose to employ a vision-language model (VLM) to infer behavioral intentions as comprehensive textual features directly from video inputs. The inferred intentions are then fused with visual features through a multi-modality fusion strategy, resulting in intention-enhanced visual representations. These enhanced visual representations, along with textual prompts, are fed into LLM for future action anticipation. Furthermore, we propose an effective example selection strategy jointly considers visual and textual similarities, providing more relevant and informative examples for in-context learning. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA GAZE+ datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing attention-backed segmentation methods suffer from boundary instability and contextual discontinuities during feature mapping, our framework implements a higher-dimensional geometric smoothing method to establish a robust manifold relationships between visually coherent regions. GeloVec combines modified Chebyshev distance metrics with multispatial transformations to enhance segmentation accuracy through stabilized feature extraction. The core innovation lies in the adaptive sampling weights system that calculates geometric distances in n-dimensional feature space, achieving superior edge preservation while maintaining intra-class homogeneity. The multispatial transformation matrix incorporates tensorial projections with orthogonal basis vectors, creating more discriminative feature representations without sacrificing computational efficiency. Experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, with mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) gains of 2.1%, 2.7%, and 2.4% on Caltech Birds-200, LSDSC, and FSSD datasets respectively compared to state-of-the-art methods. GeloVec's mathematical foundation in Riemannian geometry provides theoretical guarantees on segmentation stability. Importantly, our framework maintains computational efficiency through parallelized implementation of geodesic transformations and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across disciplines due to the absence of information loss during transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Moreover, style noise, such as illumination and color contrast, reduces the identity discriminability and modality invariance of features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and Decoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different modalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant features within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian descriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality alignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we propose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which decomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related components, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the textual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter and the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian semantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided Feature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information for identification from the style-related features and restores it back into the pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the features after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with that between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DSFAD.</p></details> |  | None |

Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior, caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB) medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures | None |

While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 workshop</p></details> | None |
| **[DGFNet: End-to-End Audio-Visual Source Separation Based on Dynamic Gating Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21366v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Audio-Visual Source Separation methods primarily adopt two design strategies. The first strategy involves fusing audio and visual features at the bottleneck layer of the encoder, followed by processing the fused features through the decoder. However, when there is a significant disparity between the two modalities, this approach may lead to the loss of critical information. The second strategy avoids direct fusion and instead relies on the decoder to handle the interaction between audio and visual features. Nonetheless, if the encoder fails to integrate information across modalities adequately, the decoder may be unable to effectively capture the complex relationships between them. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic fusion method based on a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the modality fusion degree. This approach mitigates the limitations of solely relying on the decoder and facilitates efficient collaboration between audio and visual features. Additionally, an audio attention module is introduced to enhance the expressive capacity of audio features, thereby further improving model performance.

| **[Exploiting Defenses against GAN-Based Feature Inference Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12571v5)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized model training framework that aims to merge isolated data islands while maintaining data privacy. However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

Post training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning often struggles with overfitting to known concepts and may be overly reliant on memorized text features, limiting its adaptability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Federated Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on comprehensive contextual information -- image-conditioned features and textual attribute features of a class -- that is multimodal in nature. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through cross-attention, enabling richer contexual integration. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets spanning three generalization settings demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world scenarios often involve intricate multi-image inputs, leading to a notable performance decline as models struggle to disentangle critical information scattered across complex visual features. In this work, we propose Focus-Centric Visual Chain, a novel paradigm that enhances VLMs'perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities in multi-image scenarios. To facilitate this paradigm, we propose Focus-Centric Data Synthesis, a scalable bottom-up approach for synthesizing high-quality data with elaborate reasoning paths. Through this approach, We construct VISC-150K, a large-scale dataset with reasoning data in the form of Focus-Centric Visual Chain, specifically designed for multi-image tasks. Experimental results on seven multi-image benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves average performance gains of 3.16% and 2.24% across two distinct model architectures, without compromising the general vision-language capabilities. our study represents a significant step toward more robust and capable vision-language systems that can handle complex visual scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods fail to relocalize when faced with significantly different viewpoints. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map Alignment Anywhere), a global localization method capable of localizing in challenging and diverse environments by creating and aligning maps of open-set and view-invariant objects. ROMAN formulates and solves a registration problem between object submaps using a unified graph-theoretic global data association approach with a novel incorporation of a gravity direction prior and object shape and semantic similarity. This work's open-set object mapping and information-rich object association algorithm enables global localization, even in instances when maps are created from robots traveling in opposite directions. Through a set of challenging global localization experiments in indoor, urban, and unstructured/forested environments, we demonstrate that ROMAN achieves higher relative pose estimation accuracy than other image-based pose estimation methods or segment-based registration methods. Additionally, we evaluate ROMAN as a loop closure module in large-scale multi-robot SLAM and show a 35% improvement in trajectory estimation error compared to standard SLAM systems using visual features for loop closures.

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable clinical documentation.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features. Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025, 11 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables,</p></details> | None |

HumMorph renders a human actor in any specified pose given a few observed views (starting from just one) in arbitrary poses. Our method enables fast inference as it relies only on feed-forward passes through the model. We first construct a coarse representation of the actor in the canonical T-pose, which combines visual features from individual partial observations and fills missing information using learned prior knowledge. The coarse representation is complemented by fine-grained pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the observed views, which provide high-resolution appearance information. We show that HumMorph is competitive with the state-of-the-art when only a single input view is available, however, we achieve results with significantly better visual quality given just 2 monocular observations. Moreover, previous generalized methods assume access to accurate body shape and pose parameters obtained using synchronized multi-camera setups. In contrast, we consider a more practical scenario where these body parameters are noisily estimated directly from the observed views. Our experimental results demonstrate that our architecture is more robust to errors in the noisy parameters and clearly outperforms the state of the art in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jakubzadrozny.github.io/hummorph</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jakubzadrozny.github.io/hummorph) |

With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |

We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency. FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA) captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Visual feature map proves the superiority of FIM in enriching detail characterization. Frequency error map validates IISA productively improve the frequency fidelity. Local attribution map validates FCSA effectively captures global context.</p></details> | 11pages,8figures | None |

Existing token pruning methods often overlook fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially in complex edge regions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, how to further enhance 3D LMMs to achieve fine-grained scene understanding and facilitate flexible human-agent interaction remains a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce 3D-LLaVA, a simple yet highly powerful 3D LMM designed to act as an intelligent assistant in comprehending, reasoning, and interacting with the 3D world. Unlike existing top-performing methods that rely on complicated pipelines-such as offline multi-view feature extraction or additional task-specific heads-3D-LLaVA adopts a minimalist design with integrated architecture and only takes point clouds as input. At the core of 3D-LLaVA is a new Omni Superpoint Transformer (OST), which integrates three functionalities: (1) a visual feature selector that converts and selects visual tokens, (2) a visual prompt encoder that embeds interactive visual prompts into the visual token space, and (3) a referring mask decoder that produces 3D masks based on text description. This versatile OST is empowered by the hybrid pretraining to obtain perception priors and leveraged as the visual connector that bridges the 3D data to the LLM.

While multi-stage pipelines or diffusion models yield high-quality results, they suffer from high computational costs. Some approaches perform well on specific individuals with low resources, yet still exhibit mismatched lip movements. The aforementioned methods are modeled in the pixel domain. We observed that there are noticeable discrepancies in the frequency domain between the synthesized talking videos and natural videos. Currently, no research on talking portrait synthesis has considered this aspect. To address this, we propose a FREquency-modulated, high-fidelity, and real-time Audio-driven talKing portrait synthesis framework, named FREAK, which models talking portraits from the frequency domain perspective, enhancing the fidelity and naturalness of the synthesized portraits. FREAK introduces two novel frequency-based modules: 1) the Visual Encoding Frequency Modulator (VEFM) to couple multi-scale visual features in the frequency domain, better preserving visual frequency information and reducing the gap in the frequency spectrum between synthesized and natural frames. and 2) the Audio Visual Frequency Modulator (AVFM) to help the model learn the talking pattern in the frequency domain and improve audio-visual synchronization. Additionally, we optimize the model in both pixel domain and frequency domain jointly. Furthermore, FREAK supports seamless switching between one-shot and video dubbing settings, offering enhanced flexibility. Due to its superior performance, it can simultaneously support high-resolution video results and real-time inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method synthesizes high-fidelity talking portraits with detailed facial textures and precise lip synchronization in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> | None |

The proposed work introduces a novel framework for generating natural language descriptions from video datasets by combining textual and visual modalities. The suggested architecture makes use of ResNet50 to extract visual features from video frames that are taken from the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD), and Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) datasets. The extracted visual characteristics are converted into patch embeddings and then run through an encoder-decoder model based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2). In order to align textual and visual representations and guarantee high-quality description production, the system uses multi-head self-attention and cross-attention techniques. The model's efficacy is demonstrated by performance evaluation using BLEU (1-4), CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. The suggested framework outperforms traditional methods with BLEU-4 scores of 0.755 (BDD-X) and 0.778 (MSVD), CIDEr scores of 1.235 (BDD-X) and 1.315 (MSVD), METEOR scores of 0.312 (BDD-X) and 0.329 (MSVD), and ROUGE-L scores of 0.782 (BDD-X) and 0.795 (MSVD).

In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection.

Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, GUI datasets often generate annotation information through automatic labeling, which commonly results in inaccurate GUI element BBox annotations, including missing, duplicate, or meaningless BBoxes. These issues can degrade the performance of models trained on these datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally, existing GUI datasets only provide BBox annotations visually, which restricts the development of visually related GUI downstream tasks. To address these issues, we introduce PixelWeb, a large-scale GUI dataset containing over 100,000 annotated web pages. PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that integrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure analysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis. Channel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of occlusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap annotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and stacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally, PixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and mask annotations. Manual verification by three independent annotators confirms the high quality and accuracy of PixelWeb annotations. Experimental results on GUI element detection tasks show that PixelWeb achieves performance on the mAP95 metric that is 3-7 times better than existing datasets.

However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

| **[Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning for Multi-Task Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16145v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task visual grounding (MTVG) includes two sub-tasks, i.e., Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Segmentation (RES). The existing representative approaches generally follow the research pipeline which mainly consists of three core procedures, including independent feature extraction for visual and linguistic modalities, respectively, cross-modal interaction module, and independent prediction heads for different sub-tasks. Albeit achieving remarkable performance, this research line has two limitations: 1) The linguistic content has not been fully injected into the entire visual backbone for boosting more effective visual feature extraction and it needs an extra cross-modal interaction module; 2) The relationship between REC and RES tasks is not effectively exploited to help the collaborative prediction for more accurate output. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning framework for multi-task visual grounding, called PLVL, which not only finely mine the inherent feature expression of the visual modality itself but also progressively inject the language information to help learn linguistic-related visual features. In this manner, our PLVL does not need additional cross-modal fusion module while fully introducing the language guidance. Furthermore, we analyze that the localization center for REC would help identify the to-be-segmented object region for RES to some extent. Inspired by this investigation, we design a multi-task head to accomplish collaborative predictions for these two sub-tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that our PLVL obviously outperforms the representative methods in both REC and RES tasks. https://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jcwang0602/PLVL) |

The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Beyond key video segment extraction from the raw laryngeal videos, MLVAS is able to generate effective audio and visual features for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. Pre-trained audio encoders are utilized to encode the patient voice to get the audio features. Visual features are generated by measuring the angle deviation of both the left and right vocal folds to the estimated glottal midline on the segmented glottis masks. To get better masks, we introduce a diffusion-based refinement that follows traditional U-Net segmentation to reduce false positives. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and modalities in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, unilateral VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | Submitted to CSL | None |

Despite extensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial gaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive rationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive interpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present Chimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework to derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental drivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and affective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional responses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first incorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it extracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation) and fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates them into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic). Finally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a large language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues evoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental results on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as GPT-4o.

A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EmoSEM: Segment and Explain Emotion Stimuli in Visual Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14658v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on a key challenge in visual art understanding: given an art image, the model pinpoints pixel regions that trigger a specific human emotion, and generates linguistic explanations for the emotional arousal. Despite recent advances in art understanding, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual challenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion makes it difficult for general segmentation models like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second, the abstract nature of art expression makes it difficult for captioning models to balance pixel-level semantic understanding and emotion reasoning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the segmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with the language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain semantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. The method innovatively realizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level emotion interpretation, providing the first interpretable fine-grained analysis framework for artistic emotion computing. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous works address this challenge by utilizing Vision-Language Models and mask proposal networks for region-text matching. However, this paradigm may lead to incorrect target localization due to the inherent ambiguity and diversity of free-form referring expressions. To alleviate this issue, we present LGD (Leveraging Generative Descriptions), a framework that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models to enhance region-text matching performance in Vision-Language Models. Specifically, we first design two kinds of prompts, the attribute prompt and the surrounding prompt, to guide the Multi-Modal Large Language Models in generating descriptions related to the crucial attributes of the referent object and the details of surrounding objects, referred to as attribute description and surrounding description, respectively. Secondly, three visual-text matching scores are introduced to evaluate the similarity between instance-level visual features and textual features, which determines the mask most associated with the referring expression. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, with maximum improvements of 9.97% in oIoU and 11.29% in mIoU compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  | None |

ResNetVLLM addresses the challenges associated with zero-shot video models by avoiding reliance on pre-trained video understanding models and instead employing a non-pretrained ResNet to extract visual features. This design ensures the model learns visual and semantic representations within a unified architecture, enhancing its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions from video inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that ResNetVLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot video understanding (ZSVU) on several benchmarks, including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, TGIF-QA FrameQA, and ActivityNet-QA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional attention mechanisms, despite notable benchmarks, are hindered by quadratic complexity, limiting their ability to fully capture global contextual dependencies and rich semantic information in both modalities. To address this limitation, we introduce DualKanbaFormer, a novel framework that leverages parallel Textual and Visual KanbaFormer modules for robust multimodal analysis. Our approach incorporates Aspect-Driven Sparse Attention (ADSA) to dynamically balance coarse-grained aggregation and fine-grained selection for aspect-focused precision, ensuring the preservation of both global context awareness and local precision in textual and visual representations. Additionally, we utilize the Selective State Space Model (Mamba) to capture extensive global semantic information across both modalities. Furthermore, We replace traditional feed-forward networks and normalization with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Dynamic Tanh (DyT) to enhance non-linear expressivity and inference stability. To facilitate the effective integration of textual and visual features, we design a multimodal gated fusion layer that dynamically optimizes inter-modality interactions, significantly enhancing the models efficacy in MABSA tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets reveal that DualKanbaFormer consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, conventional lesion segmentation models lack the flexibility to distinguish lesions according to specific requirements. Given the practical advantages of using text as guidance, we propose a novel model, Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor (LSMS), which segments target lesions in medical images based on given textual expressions. We define this as a new task termed Referring Lesion Segmentation (RLS). To address the lack of suitable benchmarks for RLS, we construct a vision-language medical dataset named Reference Hepatic Lesion Segmentation (RefHL-Seg). LSMS incorporates two key designs: (i) Scale-Aware Vision-Language attention module, which performs visual feature extraction and vision-language alignment in parallel. By leveraging diverse convolutional kernels, this module acquires rich visual representations and interacts closely with linguistic features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for precise object localization. (ii) Full-Scale Decoder, which globally models multi-modal features across multiple scales and captures complementary information between them to accurately delineate lesion boundaries. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function comprising both segmentation loss and vision-language contrastive loss to better optimize cross-modal learning. We validate the performance of LSMS on RLS as well as on conventional lesion segmentation tasks across multiple datasets. Our LSMS consistently achieves superior performance with significantly lower computational cost. Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although the vMF distribution is widely employed in a variety of probabilistic learning tasks involving spherical data, principled tools for comparing vMF distributions remain limited, primarily due to the intractability of normalization constants and the absence of suitable geometric metrics. Motivated by the theory of optimal transport, we propose a Wasserstein-like distance that decomposes the discrepancy between two vMF distributions into two interpretable components: a geodesic term capturing the angular separation between mean directions, and a variance-like term quantifying differences in concentration parameters. The derivation leverages a Gaussian approximation in the high-concentration regime to yield a tractable, closed-form expression that respects the intrinsic spherical geometry. We show that the proposed distance exhibits desirable theoretical properties and induces a latent geometric structure on the space of non-degenerate vMF distributions. As a primary application, we develop the efficient algorithms for vMF mixture reduction, enabling structure-preserving compression of mixture models in high-dimensional settings. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and real-world high-dimensional embeddings, including biomedical sentence representations and deep visual features, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed geometry in distinguishing distributions and supporting interpretable inference. This work expands the statistical toolbox for directional data analysis by introducing a tractable, transport-inspired distance tailored to the geometry of the hypersphere.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnomalyControl: Learning Cross-modal Semantic Features for Controllable Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06510v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for advancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

We propose instead an estimation-based version of the problem: we label Rough Crowd Counting that delivers better accuracy on the basis of training data that is easier to acquire. Rough crowd counting requires only rough annotations of the number of targets in an image, instead of the more traditional, and far more expensive, per-target annotations. We propose an approach to the rough crowd counting problem based on CLIP, termed ProgRoCC. Specifically, we introduce a progressive estimation learning strategy that determines the object count through a coarse-to-fine approach. This approach delivers answers quickly, outperforms the state-of-the-art in semi- and weakly-supervised crowd counting. In addition, we design a vision-language matching adapter that optimizes key-value pairs by mining effective matches of two modalities to refine the visual features, thereby improving the final performance. Extensive experimental results on three widely adopted crowd counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Noisy data with wrong labels affects the robustness and generalization ability of deep neural networks. Previous noise learning methods mainly considered noise arising from images being mislabeled, i.e. label noise, assuming that all mislabeled images are of high image quality. However, medical images are prone to suffering extreme quality issues, i.e. data noise, where discriminative visual features are missing for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a noise learning framework, termed as QMix, that learns a robust disease diagnosis model under mixed noise. QMix alternates between sample separation and quality-aware semisupervised training in each training epoch. In the sample separation phase, we design a joint uncertainty-loss criterion to effectively separate (1) correctly labeled images; (2) mislabeled images with high quality and (3) mislabeled images with low quality. In the semi-supervised training phase, we train a disease diagnosis model to learn robust feature representation from the separated samples. Specifically, we devise a sample-reweighing loss to mitigate the effect of mislabeled images with low quality during training. Meanwhile, a contrastive enhancement loss is proposed to further distinguish mislabeled images with low quality from correctly labeled images. QMix achieved state-of-the-art disease diagnosis performance on five public retinal image datasets and exhibited substantial improvement on robustness against mixed noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in large multi-modal models, notably Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have motivated researchers to incorporate CLIP into dual-stream-based VQA methods. This integration aims to harness the model's superior semantic understanding capabilities to replicate the object recognition and detail analysis in ventral stream, as well as spatial relationship analysis in dorsal stream. However, CLIP is originally designed for images and lacks the ability to capture temporal and motion information inherent in videos.To address the limitation, this paper propose a Decoupled Vision-Language Modeling with Text-Guided Adaptation for Blind Video Quality Assessment (DVLTA-VQA), which decouples CLIP's visual and textual components, and integrates them into different stages of the NR-VQA pipeline. Specifically, a Video-Based Temporal CLIP module is proposed to explicitly model temporal dynamics and enhance motion perception, aligning with the dorsal stream. Additionally, a Temporal Context Module is developed to refine inter-frame dependencies, further improving motion modeling. On the ventral stream side, a Basic Visual Feature Extraction Module is employed to strengthen detail analysis. Finally, a text-guided adaptive fusion strategy is proposed to enable dynamic weighting of features, facilitating more effective integration of spatial and temporal information.</p></details> |  | None |

While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet.

Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images, with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to compromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To obtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is domain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted images. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the domain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e., the positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder (LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG framework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative improvements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C).

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter) |
| **[Kernel-Aware Graph Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17619v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

| **[Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11496v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures | None |

In computer vision, IVD has become an emerging task that leverages video from surveillance cameras and audio from remote microphones to localize and classify vehicles in each frame as moving, idling, or engine-off. As with other cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence between audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide complementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio conveys engine activity beyond the visual field. The previous end-to-end model, which uses a basic attention mechanism, struggles to align these modalities effectively, often missing vehicle detections. To address this issue, we propose AVIVDNetv2, a transformer-based end-to-end detection network. It incorporates a cross-modal transformer with global patch-level learning, a multiscale visual feature fusion module, and decoupled detection heads. Extensive experiments show that AVIVDNetv2 improves mAP by 7.66 over the disjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline, with consistent AP gains across all vehicle categories. Furthermore, AVIVDNetv2 outperforms the state-of-the-art method for sounding object localization, establishing a new performance benchmark on the AVIVD dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the lack of high-quality datasets and the high cost of pixel annotation greatly limit the development of them. Considering the well-performed few-shot learning methods for downstream tasks, we investigate the application of the few-shot learning method to scene text segmentation. We propose TSAL, which leverages CLIP's prior knowledge to learn text attributes for segmentation. To fully utilize the semantic and texture information in the image, a visual-guided branch is proposed to separately extract text and background features. To reduce data dependency and improve text detection accuracy, the adaptive prompt-guided branch employs effective adaptive prompt templates to capture various text attributes. To enable adaptive prompts capture distinctive text features and complex background distribution, we propose Adaptive Feature Alignment module(AFA). By aligning learnable tokens of different attributes with visual features and prompt prototypes, AFA enables adaptive prompts to capture both general and distinctive attribute information. TSAL can capture the unique attributes of text and achieve precise segmentation using only few images. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance on multiple text segmentation datasets under few-shot settings and show great potential in text-related domains.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification. Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions, accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these tasks are challenging due to the diversity and richness of visual features. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-informed feature discovery framework that leverages multimodal LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to evaluate content credibility and explain its reasoning. We extract and quantify interpretable features using targeted prompts and integrate them into machine learning models to improve credibility predictions. We tested this approach on 4,191 visual social media posts across eight topics in science, health, and politics, using credibility ratings from 5,355 crowdsourced workers. Our method outperformed zero-shot GPT-based predictions by 13 percent in R2, and revealed key features like information concreteness and image format. We discuss the implications for misinformation mitigation, visual credibility, and the role of LLMs in social science.</p></details> | 26 pages | None |

Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal Representation Learning Techniques for Comprehensive Facial State Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10351v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models have significantly improved feature representation by integrating information from multiple modalities, making them highly suitable for a broader set of applications. However, the exploration of multimodal facial representation for understanding perception has been limited. Understanding and analyzing facial states, such as Action Units (AUs) and emotions, require a comprehensive and robust framework that bridges visual and linguistic modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive pipeline for multimodal facial state analysis. First, we compile a new Multimodal Face Dataset (MFA) by generating detailed multilevel language descriptions of face, incorporating Action Unit (AU) and emotion descriptions, by leveraging GPT-4o. Second, we introduce a novel Multilevel Multimodal Face Foundation model (MF^2) tailored for Action Unit (AU) and emotion recognition. Our model incorporates comprehensive visual feature modeling at both local and global levels of face image, enhancing its ability to represent detailed facial appearances. This design aligns visual representations with structured AU and emotion descriptions, ensuring effective cross-modal integration. Third, we develop a Decoupled Fine-Tuning Network (DFN) that efficiently adapts MF^2 across various tasks and datasets. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also broadens the applicability of the foundation model to diverse scenarios. Experimentation show superior performance for AU and emotion detection tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during LLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the entire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens. Our ablation studies show that FUSION outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on over half of the benchmarks under same configuration without dynamic resolution, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

However, existing works are primarily limited to single-subject oriented text-to-video generation, leaving the more challenging problem of customized multi-subject generation unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel VideoDreamer framework, which can generate temporally consistent text-guided videos that faithfully preserve the visual features of the given multiple subjects. Specifically, VideoDreamer adopts the pretrained Stable Diffusion with temporal modules as its base video generator, taking the power of the text-to-image model to generate diversified content. The video generator is further customized for multi-subjects, which leverages the proposed Disen-Mix Finetuning and Human-in-the-Loop Re-finetuning strategy, to tackle the attribute binding problem of multi-subject generation. Additionally, we present a disentangled motion customization strategy to finetune the temporal modules so that we can generate videos with both customized subjects and motions. To evaluate the performance of customized multi-subject text-to-video generation, we introduce the MultiStudioBench benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of VideoDreamer to generate videos with new content such as new events and backgrounds, tailored to the customized multiple subjects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Granularity Language-Guided Training for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04844v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing multi-object tracking methods typically learn visual tracking features via maximizing dis-similarities of different instances and minimizing similarities of the same instance. While such a feature learning scheme achieves promising performance, learning discriminative features solely based on visual information is challenging especially in case of environmental interference such as occlusion, blur and domain variance. In this work, we argue that multi-modal language-driven features provide complementary information to classical visual features, thereby aiding in improving the robustness to such environmental interference. To this end, we propose a new multi-object tracking framework, named LG-MOT, that explicitly leverages language information at different levels of granularity (scene-and instance-level) and combines it with standard visual features to obtain discriminative representations. To develop LG-MOT, we annotate existing MOT datasets with scene-and instance-level language descriptions. We then encode both instance-and scene-level language information into high-dimensional embeddings, which are utilized to guide the visual features during training. At inference, our LG-MOT uses the standard visual features without relying on annotated language descriptions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, MOT17, DanceTrack and SportsMOT, reveal the merits of the proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance. On the DanceTrack test set, our LG-MOT achieves an absolute gain of 2.2\% in terms of target object association (IDF1 score), compared to the baseline using only visual features. Further, our LG-MOT exhibits strong cross-domain generalizability.

Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical image translation, Diffusion model, 16 pages</p></details> | None |

This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.</p></details> |  | None |

For instance, given an image of a person holding a bouquet of flowers, we may focus on either the person such as their clothing, or the type of flowers, depending on the context of interest. Yet, most existing image encoding paradigms represent an image as a fixed, generic feature vector, overlooking the potential needs of prioritizing varying visual information for different downstream use cases. In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP. In addition, we show FocalLens further leads to performance improvements on a range of downstream tasks including image-image retrieval, image classification, and image-text retrieval, with an average gain of 5 and 10 points on the challenging SugarCrepe and MMVP-VLM benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to identify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like motion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However, segmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing methods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose MovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text prompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused with visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a Vision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation. The segmentation results then undergo a deep thinking refinement loop, allowing MovSAM to iteratively improve its understanding of the scene context and inter-object relationships with logical reasoning. This innovative approach enables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene understanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical application and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the multi-frame methods fail. Furthermore, despite the inherent advantage of multi-frame methods in utilizing temporal information, MovSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across public MOS benchmarks, reaching 92.5\% on J\&F. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MovSAM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/IRMVLab/MovSAM) |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) obtain frame-level understanding capabilities through multi-frame input, they suffer from information loss due to the sparse sampling strategy. In contrast, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) capture temporal relationships within visual features but are limited by the scarcity of high-quality video-text datasets. To transfer long video understanding capabilities to VLMs with minimal data and computational cost, we propose Lightweight Video Compression (LVC), a novel method featuring the Query-Attention Video Compression mechanism, which effectively tackles the sparse sampling problem in VLMs. By training only the alignment layer with 10k short video-text pairs, LVC significantly enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of VLMs. Extensive experiments show that LVC provides consistent performance improvements across various models, including the InternVL2 series and Phi-3.5-Vision. Notably, the InternVL2-40B-LVC achieves scores of 68.2 and 65.9 on the long video understanding benchmarks MLVU and Video-MME, respectively, with relative improvements of 14.6% and 7.7%.

To address this, we introduce a layer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes self-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention to focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework, where the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT allows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features, progressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally interpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the refined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves consistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models. These results highlight the effectiveness of EDIT's design in addressing attention sink and improving visual feature extraction.</p></details> |  | None |

This damage can be identified through machine learning techniques, providing an early risk marker for potential major cardiovascular events and offering valuable insights into the overall arterial condition of individual patients. To this end, the VideoMAE deep learning model, originally developed for video classification, was adapted by finetuning for application in the domain of ultrasound imaging. The model was trained and tested using a dataset comprising over 31,000 carotid sonography videos sourced from the Gutenberg Health Study (15,010 participants), one of the largest prospective population health studies. This adaptation facilitates the classification of individuals as hypertensive or non-hypertensive (75.7% validation accuracy), functioning as a proxy for detecting visual arterial damage. We demonstrate that our machine learning model effectively captures visual features that provide valuable insights into an individual's overall cardiovascular health.</p></details> |  | None |

To investigate the interaction between geometric structure and texture in shaping visual attention, we establish a comprehensive mesh saliency dataset, which is the first to systematically capture the differences in saliency distribution under both textured and non-textured visual conditions. Furthermore, we introduce mesh Mamba, a unified saliency prediction model based on a state space model (SSM), designed to adapt across various mesh types. Mesh Mamba effectively analyzes the geometric structure of the mesh while seamlessly incorporating texture features into the topological framework, ensuring coherence throughout appearance-enhanced modeling. More importantly, by subgraph embedding and a bidirectional SSM, the model enables global context modeling for both local geometry and texture, preserving the topological structure and improving the understanding of visual details and structural complexity. Through extensive theoretical and empirical validation, our model not only improves performance across various mesh types but also demonstrates high scalability and versatility, particularly through cross validations of various visual features.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, their ability to reason with complex images in academic domains has not been systematically investigated. To bridge this gap, we present SCI-Reason, a dataset for complex multimodel reasoning in academic areas. SCI-Reason aims to test and improve the reasoning ability of large multimodal models using real complex images in academic domains. The dataset contains 12,066 images and 12,626 question-answer pairs extracted from PubMed, divided into training, validation and test splits. Each question-answer pair also contains an accurate and efficient inference chain as a guide to improving the inference properties of the dataset. With SCI-Reason, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of 8 well-known models. The best performing model, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, only achieved an accuracy of 55.19%. Error analysis shows that more than half of the model failures are due to breakdowns in multi-step inference chains rather than errors in primary visual feature extraction. This finding underscores the inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities exhibited by current multimodal models when processing complex image analysis tasks within authentic academic contexts. Experiments on open-source models show that SCI-Reason not only enhances reasoning ability but also demonstrates cross-domain generalization in VQA tasks. We also explore future applications of model inference capabilities in this domain, highlighting its potential for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCV 2025. 11 pages (including references)</p></details> | None |

Creating such posters using modern image generation methods is valuable, while the main challenge lies in accurately rendering text, especially for complex writing systems like Chinese, which contains over 10,000 individual characters. In this work, we identify the key to precise text rendering as constructing a character-discriminative visual feature as a control signal. Based on this insight, we propose a robust character-wise representation as control and we develop TextRenderNet, which achieves a high text rendering accuracy of over 90%. Another challenge in poster generation is maintaining the fidelity of user-specific products. We address this by introducing SceneGenNet, an inpainting-based model, and propose subject fidelity feedback learning to further enhance fidelity. Based on TextRenderNet and SceneGenNet, we present PosterMaker, an end-to-end generation framework. To optimize PosterMaker efficiently, we implement a two-stage training strategy that decouples text rendering and background generation learning.

| **[Attributes-aware Visual Emotion Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06578v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual emotion analysis or recognition has gained considerable attention due to the growing interest in understanding how images can convey rich semantics and evoke emotions in human perception. However, visual emotion analysis poses distinctive challenges compared to traditional vision tasks, especially due to the intricate relationship between general visual features and the different affective states they evoke, known as the affective gap. Researchers have used deep representation learning methods to address this challenge of extracting generalized features from entire images. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of specific emotional attributes such as brightness, colorfulness, scene understanding, and facial expressions. Through this paper, we introduce A4Net, a deep representation network to bridge the affective gap by leveraging four key attributes: brightness (Attribute 1), colorfulness (Attribute 2), scene context (Attribute 3), and facial expressions (Attribute 4). By fusing and jointly training all aspects of attribute recognition and visual emotion analysis, A4Net aims to provide a better insight into emotional content in images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of A4Net, showcasing competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse visual emotion datasets. Furthermore, visualizations of activation maps generated by A4Net offer insights into its ability to generalize across different visual emotion datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures | None |

This trend raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks. Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines, and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that are in use today.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

Vision-based beam prediction utilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and responsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique vulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus potentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats specifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional white-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam indices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy Attack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and beam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model parameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we formulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam selection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial perturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with a dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically filter irrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features. Evaluations using standard backbone models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving up to an +21.07\% gain in Top-K accuracy under clean conditions and a 41.31\% increase in Top-1 adversarial robustness compared to different baseline models.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches, such as resamplers and summarizers, have sought to reduce the number of visual tokens, but at the cost of visual reasoning ability. To address this, we propose LEO-MINI, a novel MLLM that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and simultaneously boosts visual reasoning capabilities. For efficiency, LEO-MINI incorporates CoTR, a novel token reduction module to consolidate a large number of visual tokens into a smaller set of tokens, using the similarity between visual tokens, text tokens, and a compact learnable query. For effectiveness, to scale up the model's ability with minimal computational overhead, LEO-MINI employs MMoE, a novel mixture of multi-modal experts module. MMOE employs a set of LoRA experts with a novel router to switch between them based on the input text and visual tokens instead of only using the input hidden state. MMoE also includes a general LoRA expert that is always activated to learn general knowledge for LLM reasoning. For extracting richer visual features, MMOE employs a set of vision experts trained on diverse domain-specific data. To demonstrate LEO-MINI's improved efficiency and performance, we evaluate it against existing efficient MLLMs on various benchmark vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, most systems remain black boxes, lacking explainability during training and inference. A key challenge is integrating explicit knowledge into implicit models to create expert-driven, interpretable VAD systems. This paper introduces Rule-based Violence Monitoring (RuleVM), a novel weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD) paradigm. RuleVM employs a dual-branch architecture: an implicit branch using visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, with feature extraction split into scene frames and action channels, and an explicit branch leveraging language-image alignment for fine-grained classification. The explicit branch utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for object detection in video frames, with association rules mined from data as video descriptors. This design enables interpretable coarse- and fine-grained violence monitoring. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show RuleVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both granularities. Notably, it reveals rules like increased violence risk with crowd size.

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Highlight | None |

Unlike conventional methods that require separate branches with dedicated parameters for text recognition and detection, our approach leverages a Transformer decoder to sequentially generate text transcriptions and their spatial coordinates in a unified branch. Built on an encoder-decoder architecture, VISTA-OCR is progressively trained, starting with the visual feature extraction phase, followed by multitask learning with multimodal token generation. To address the increasing demand for versatile OCR systems capable of advanced tasks, such as content-based text localization \ref{content_based_localization}, we introduce new prompt-controllable OCR tasks during pre-training.To enhance the model's capabilities, we built a new dataset composed of real-world examples enriched with bounding box annotations and synthetic samples. Although recent Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can efficiently perform these tasks, their high computational cost remains a barrier for practical deployment. In contrast, our VISTA$_{\text{omni}}$ variant processes both handwritten and printed documents with only 150M parameters, interactively, by prompting. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that VISTA-OCR achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models on standard OCR tasks while showing strong potential for more sophisticated OCR applications, addressing the growing need for interactive OCR systems. All code and annotations for VISTA-OCR will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

If left untreated, DR can progress to retinal vein occlusion and stimulate abnormal blood vessel growth, significantly increasing the risk of blindness. Traditional diabetes diagnosis methods often utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract visual features from retinal images, followed by classification algorithms such as decision trees and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for disease detection. However, these approaches face several challenges, including low accuracy and sensitivity, lengthy machine learning (ML) model training due to high data complexity and volume, and the use of limited datasets for testing and evaluation. This study investigates the application of transfer learning (TL) to enhance ML model performance in DR detection. Key improvements include dimensionality reduction, optimized learning rate adjustments, and advanced parameter tuning algorithms, aimed at increasing efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 84% on the testing dataset, outperforming prior studies. The highest class-specific accuracy reached 89%, with a maximum sensitivity of 97% and an F1-score of 92%, demonstrating strong performance in identifying DR cases. These findings suggest that TL-based DR screening is a promising approach for early diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages,12 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |

However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Recent works like SatCLIP and GeoCLIP learn such representations by contrastively aligning geolocation with co-located images. While these methods work exceptionally well, in this paper, we posit that the current training strategies fail to fully capture the important visual features. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on why the resulting embeddings from these methods discard crucial visual information that is important for many downstream tasks. To solve this problem, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented strategy called RANGE. We build our method on the intuition that the visual features of a location can be estimated by combining the visual features from multiple similar-looking locations. We evaluate our method across a wide variety of tasks. Our results show that RANGE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models with significant margins in most tasks.

However, existing open-source VLMs predominantly trained for generic vision-language alignment tasks fail to model temporally correlated action semantics that are crucial for robotic manipulation effectively. While current image-based fine-tuning methods partially adapt VLMs to robotic applications, they fundamentally disregard temporal evolution patterns in video sequences and suffer from visual feature entanglement between robotic agents, manipulated objects, and environmental contexts, thereby limiting semantic decoupling capability for atomic actions and compromising model generalizability.To overcome these challenges, this work presents RoboAct-CLIP with dual technical contributions: 1) A dataset reconstruction framework that performs semantic-constrained action unit segmentation and re-annotation on open-source robotic videos, constructing purified training sets containing singular atomic actions (e.g., "grasp"); 2) A temporal-decoupling fine-tuning strategy based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) architecture, which disentangles temporal action features across video frames from object-centric characteristics to achieve hierarchical representation learning of robotic atomic actions.Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate that the RoboAct-CLIP pretrained model achieves a 12% higher success rate than baseline VLMs, along with superior generalization in multi-object manipulation tasks.</p></details> | IROS 2025 | None |

While traditional RES methods primarily address object-level grounding, real-world scenarios demand a more versatile framework that can handle multiple levels of target granularity, such as multi-object, single object or part-level references. This introduces great challenges due to the diverse and nuanced ways users describe targets. However, existing datasets and models mainly focus on designing grounding specialists for object-level target localization, lacking the necessary data resources and unified frameworks for the more practical multi-grained RES. In this paper, we take a step further towards visual granularity unified RES task. To overcome the limitation of data scarcity, we introduce a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task, alongside the RefCOCOm benchmark, which includes part-level annotations for advancing finer-grained visual understanding. In addition, we create MRES-32M, the largest visual grounding dataset, comprising over 32.2M masks and captions across 1M images, specifically designed for part-level vision-language grounding. To tackle the challenges of multi-granularity RES, we propose UniRES++, a unified multimodal large language model that integrates object-level and part-level RES tasks. UniRES++ incorporates targeted designs for fine-grained visual feature exploration. With the joint model architecture and parameters, UniRES++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including RefCOCOm for MRES, gRefCOCO for generalized RES, and RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg for classic RES. To foster future research into multi-grained visual grounding, our RefCOCOm benchmark, MRES-32M dataset and model UniRES++ will be publicly available at https://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES) |

However, biased T2I models can generate content with specific tendencies, potentially influencing people's perceptions. Intentional exploitation of these biases risks conveying misleading information to the public. Current research on bias primarily addresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns, such as skin color and gender. This paper introduces a novel form of implicit bias that lacks explicit visual features but can manifest in diverse ways across various semantic contexts. This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging to detect, easy to propagate, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. We further propose an implicit bias injection attack framework (IBI-Attacks) against T2I diffusion models by precomputing a general bias direction in the prompt embedding space and adaptively adjusting it based on different inputs. Our attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our scheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while preserving the original semantics. The strong concealment and transferability of our attack across various scenarios further underscore the significance of our approach.

| **[Q-Adapt: Adapting LMM for Visual Quality Assessment with Progressive Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01655v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Multi-modal Foundation Models (LMM) has paved the way for the possible Explainable Image Quality Assessment (EIQA) with instruction tuning from two perspectives: overall quality explanation, and attribute-wise perception answering. However, existing works usually overlooked the conflicts between these two types of perception explanations during joint instruction tuning, leading to insufficient perception understanding. To mitigate this, we propose a new paradigm for perception-oriented instruction tuning, i.e., Q-Adapt, which aims to eliminate the conflicts and achieve the synergy between these two EIQA tasks when adapting LMM, resulting in enhanced multi-faceted explanations of IQA. Particularly, we propose a progressive instruction tuning strategy by dividing the adaption process of LMM for EIQA into two stages, where the first stage empowers the LMM with universal perception knowledge tailored for two tasks using an efficient transfer learning strategy, i.e., LoRA, and the second stage introduces the instruction-adaptive visual prompt tuning to dynamically adapt visual features for the different instructions from two tasks. In this way, our proposed Q-Adapt can achieve a lightweight visual quality evaluator, demonstrating comparable performance and, in some instances, superior results across perceptual-related benchmarks and commonly-used IQA databases.

| **[STPNet: Scale-aware Text Prompt Network for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01561v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of lesions plays a critical role in medical image analysis and diagnosis. Traditional segmentation approaches that rely solely on visual features often struggle with the inherent uncertainty in lesion distribution and size. To address these issues, we propose STPNet, a Scale-aware Text Prompt Network that leverages vision-language modeling to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach utilizes multi-scale textual descriptions to guide lesion localization and employs retrieval-segmentation joint learning to bridge the semantic gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Crucially, STPNet retrieves relevant textual information from a specialized medical text repository during training, eliminating the need for text input during inference while retaining the benefits of cross-modal learning. We evaluate STPNet on three datasets: COVID-Xray, COVID-CT, and Kvasir-SEG. Experimental results show that our vision-language approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating textual semantic knowledge into medical image analysis. The code has been made publicly on https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/STPNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/STPNet) |
| **[TimeSearch: Hierarchical Video Search with Spotlight and Reflection for Human-like Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01407v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large video-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various video-language tasks. However, they encounter significant challenges when processing long videos because of the large number of video frames involved. Downsampling long videos in either space or time can lead to visual hallucinations, making it difficult to accurately interpret long videos. Motivated by human hierarchical temporal search strategies, we propose \textbf{TimeSearch}, a novel framework enabling LVLMs to understand long videos in a human-like manner. TimeSearch integrates two human-like primitives into a unified autoregressive LVLM: 1) \textbf{Spotlight} efficiently identifies relevant temporal events through a Temporal-Augmented Frame Representation (TAFR), explicitly binding visual features with timestamps; 2) \textbf{Reflection} evaluates the correctness of the identified events, leveraging the inherent temporal self-reflection capabilities of LVLMs. TimeSearch progressively explores key events and prioritizes temporal search based on reflection confidence. Extensive experiments on challenging long-video benchmarks confirm that TimeSearch substantially surpasses previous state-of-the-art, improving the accuracy from 41.8\% to 51.5\% on the LVBench. Additionally, experiments on temporal grounding demonstrate that appropriate TAFR is adequate to effectively stimulate the surprising temporal grounding ability of LVLMs in a simpler yet versatile manner, which improves mIoU on Charades-STA by 11.8\%. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text and existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repo ...</summary><p>Repo can be found here: https://github.com/alexmartin1722/wikivideo</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/alexmartin1722/wikivideo) |

Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop on ELVM</p></details> | None |
| **[Local Information Matters: Inference Acceleration For Grounded Conversation Generation Models Through Adaptive Local-Aware Token Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23959v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) is an emerging vision-language task that requires models to generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. Recent models, such as GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA, achieve pixel-level grounding but incur significant computational costs due to processing a large number of visual tokens. Existing token pruning methods, like FastV and PyramidDrop, fail to preserve the local visual features critical for accurate grounding, leading to substantial performance drops in GCG tasks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Local-Aware Token Pruning (ALTP), a simple yet effective framework that accelerates GCG models by prioritizing local object information. ALTP introduces two key components: (1) Detail Density Capture (DDC), which uses superpixel segmentation to retain tokens in object-centric regions, preserving fine-grained details, and (2) Dynamic Density Formation (DDF), which dynamically allocates tokens based on information density, ensuring higher retention in semantically rich areas. Extensive experiments on the GranDf dataset demonstrate that ALTP significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods, such as FastV and PyramidDrop, on both GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA models. Notably, when applied to GLaMM, ALTP achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens with a 4.9% improvement in AP50 and a 5.0% improvement in Recall compared to PyramidDrop. Similarly, on OMG-LLaVA, ALTP improves AP by 2.1% and mIOU by 3.0% at a 90% token reduction compared with PDrop.</p></details> |  | None |

While CLIP and its variants excel in the global alignment of image and text representations, they often struggle to capture the fine-grained details necessary for precise segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism. This approach selectively retains semantically relevant tokens, enabling the model to focus on the image's critical regions aligned with the specific functions of our model, including textual information processing, patch comparison, and image reconstruction, ensuring that the model learns high-level semantics and detailed visual features. Our experiments demonstrate that DetailCLIP surpasses existing CLIP-based and traditional self-supervised learning (SSL) models in segmentation accuracy and exhibits superior generalization across diverse datasets.

However, hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that MLLM visual encoders often fail to distinguish visually different yet semantically similar video pairs, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding. It consists of 5,002 videos, paired to highlight cases prone to hallucinations. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results show that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks.

| **[Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation with WordNet-Relaxed Text Embeddings for Robust Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24017v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) aims to enhance a unimodal student using a multimodal teacher model. In particular, when the teacher's modalities include the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to improve knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets typically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a natural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these labels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and can lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD framework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed text embeddings under a hierarchical loss. By avoiding direct use of exact class names and instead using semantically richer WordNet expansions, we mitigate label leakage and introduce more diverse textual cues. Experiments show that this strategy significantly boosts student performance, whereas noisy or overly precise text embeddings hinder distillation efficiency. Interpretability analyses confirm that WordNet-relaxed prompts encourage heavier reliance on visual features over textual shortcuts, while still effectively incorporating the newly introduced textual cues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best results on six public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing crossmodal KD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spectral-Adaptive Modulation Networks for Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23947v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that 2D convolution and self-attention exhibit distinct spectral behaviors, and optimizing their spectral properties can enhance vision model performance. However, theoretical analyses remain limited in explaining why 2D convolution is more effective in high-pass filtering than self-attention and why larger kernels favor shape bias, akin to self-attention. In this paper, we employ graph spectral analysis to theoretically simulate and compare the frequency responses of 2D convolution and self-attention within a unified framework. Our results corroborate previous empirical findings and reveal that node connectivity, modulated by window size, is a key factor in shaping spectral functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a \textit{spectral-adaptive modulation} (SPAM) mixer, which processes visual features in a spectral-adaptive manner using multi-scale convolutional kernels and a spectral re-scaling mechanism to refine spectral components. Based on SPAM, we develop SPANetV2 as a novel vision backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPANetV2 outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple vision tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-language models attempt to bridge this gap, but existing approaches often process visual and textual features independently, resulting in weak cross-modal alignment. Simple fusion techniques fail due to the inherent differences between spatial visual features and sequential text embeddings. Additionally, medical terminology deviates from general language, limiting the effectiveness of off-the-shelf text encoders and further hindering vision-language alignment. We propose BiPVL-Seg, an end-to-end framework that integrates vision-language fusion and embedding alignment through architectural and training innovations, where both components reinforce each other to enhance medical image segmentation. BiPVL-Seg introduces bidirectional progressive fusion in the architecture, which facilitates stage-wise information exchange between vision and text encoders. Additionally, it incorporates global-local contrastive alignment, a training objective that enhances the text encoder's comprehension by aligning text and vision embeddings at both class and concept levels. Extensive experiments on diverse medical imaging benchmarks across CT and MR modalities demonstrate BiPVL-Seg's superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods in complex multi-class segmentation.

| **[Semantic-Spatial Feature Fusion with Dynamic Graph Refinement for Remote Sensing Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23453v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate semantically accurate descriptions that are closely linked to the visual features of remote sensing images. Existing approaches typically emphasize fine-grained extraction of visual features and capturing global information. However, they often overlook the complementary role of textual information in enhancing visual semantics and face challenges in precisely locating objects that are most relevant to the image context. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semantic-spatial feature fusion with dynamic graph refinement (SFDR) method, which integrates the semantic-spatial feature fusion (SSFF) and dynamic graph feature refinement (DGFR) modules. The SSFF module utilizes a multi-level feature representation strategy by leveraging pre-trained CLIP features, grid features, and ROI features to integrate rich semantic and spatial information. In the DGFR module, a graph attention network captures the relationships between feature nodes, while a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes objects that are most relevant to the current scene and suppresses less significant ones. Therefore, the proposed SFDR method significantly enhances the quality of the generated descriptions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.

Although textual information suffices for many domains, visually driven categories such as fashion or home decor potentially require detailed visual information related to color, style, or design. To address this challenge, we propose LaViC (Large Vision-Language Conversational Recommendation Framework), a novel approach that integrates compact image representations into dialogue-based recommendation systems. LaViC leverages a large vision-language model in a two-stage process: (1) visual knowledge self-distillation, which condenses product images from hundreds of tokens into a small set of visual tokens in a self-distillation manner, significantly reducing computational overhead, and (2) recommendation prompt tuning, which enables the model to incorporate both dialogue context and distilled visual tokens, providing a unified mechanism for capturing textual and visual features. To support rigorous evaluation of visually-aware conversational recommendation, we construct a new dataset by aligning Reddit conversations with Amazon product listings across multiple visually oriented categories (e.g., fashion, beauty, and home). This dataset covers realistic user queries and product appearances in domains where visual details are crucial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaViC significantly outperforms text-only conversational recommendation methods and open-source vision-language baselines. Moreover, LaViC achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to prominent proprietary baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), demonstrating the necessity of explicitly using visual data for capturing product attributes and showing the effectiveness of our vision-language integration.

Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%.

It inevitably requires consistent visual-semantic alignment. Existing approaches fine-tune the visual backbone by seen-class data to obtain semantic-related visual features, which may cause overfitting on seen classes with a limited number of training images. This paper proposes a novel visual and semantic prompt collaboration framework, which utilizes prompt tuning techniques for efficient feature adaptation. Specifically, we design a visual prompt to integrate the visual information for discriminative feature learning and a semantic prompt to integrate the semantic formation for visualsemantic alignment. To achieve effective prompt information integration, we further design a weak prompt fusion mechanism for the shallow layers and a strong prompt fusion mechanism for the deep layers in the network. Through the collaboration of visual and semantic prompts, we can obtain discriminative semantic-related features for generalized zero-shot image recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves favorable performance in both conventional zero-shot learning and generalized zero-shot learning benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |

Inspired by the way human interpreters rely on context for accurate translation, we incorporate additional contextual cues together with the signing video, into a new translation framework. Specifically, besides visual sign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate complementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background show, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses transcribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along with the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we fine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through extensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue to the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL -- the largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our contextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations compared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art methods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign Language dataset, and achieve competitive results.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera Ready, Project page: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/litfic/</p></details> | None |

Specifically, on BlindTest, our suite of 7 very simple tasks, including identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) how many times two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) the number of circles in an Olympic-like logo, four state-of-the-art VLMs are only 58.07% accurate on average.

Across different image resolutions and line widths, VLMs including slow-thinking models consistently struggle with those tasks that require precise spatial information when geometric primitives overlap or are close. Yet, VLMs perform at near-100% accuracy when much more space is added to separate shapes and letters.

However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases the demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose InternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and efficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we propose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates adjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed CLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention through these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual features. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module, LVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them through upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This significantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we propose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically adjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering. RVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in performance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the average metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complex anatomical structures of organs often lead to significant class imbalances, posing major challenges for deploying SSL in real-world scenarios. Despite the availability of valuable prior information, such as inter-organ relative positions and organ shape priors, existing SSL methods have yet to fully leverage these insights. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual anatomical knowledge (TAK) into the segmentation model. Specifically, we use GPT-4o to generate textual descriptions of anatomical priors, which are then encoded using a CLIP-based model. These encoded priors are injected into the segmentation model as parameters of the segmentation head. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the alignment between textual priors and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

However, existing methods still face two major challenges: (1) architectural limitations, most models rely on U-Net, which underperforms compared to the MM-DiT; and (2) the neglect of textual information, which can enhance controllability. In this work, we introduce DynamiCtrl, a novel framework that not only explores different pose-guided control structures in MM-DiT, but also reemphasizes the crucial role of text in this task. Specifically, we employ a Shared VAE encoder for both reference images and driving pose videos, eliminating the need for an additional pose encoder and simplifying the overall framework. To incorporate pose features into the full attention blocks, we propose Pose-adaptive Layer Norm (PadaLN), which utilizes adaptive layer normalization to encode sparse pose features. The encoded features are directly added to the visual input, preserving the spatiotemporal consistency of the backbone while effectively introducing pose control into MM-DiT. Furthermore, within the full attention mechanism, we align textual and visual features to enhance controllability. By leveraging text, we not only enable fine-grained control over the generated content, but also, for the first time, achieve simultaneous control over both background and motion. Experimental results verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its strong identity preservation, heterogeneous character driving, background controllability, and high-quality synthesis.

In this work, we propose ExCEL to explore CLIP's dense knowledge via a novel patch-text alignment paradigm for WSSS. Specifically, we propose Text Semantic Enrichment (TSE) and Visual Calibration (VC) modules to improve the dense alignment across both text and vision modalities. To make text embeddings semantically informative, our TSE module applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a dataset-wide knowledge base and enriches the text representations with an implicit attribute-hunting process. To mine fine-grained knowledge from visual features, our VC module first proposes Static Visual Calibration (SVC) to propagate fine-grained knowledge in a non-parametric manner. Then Learnable Visual Calibration (LVC) is further proposed to dynamically shift the frozen features towards distributions with diverse semantics. With these enhancements, ExCEL not only retains CLIP's training-free advantages but also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with much less training cost on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |
| **[OTTER: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Text-Aware Visual Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03734v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on visual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-B on CC3M. We also show that Harmony outperforms other self-supervised learning methods like iBOT and MAE across all tasks evaluated.

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR.

However, current LBMs simply list all concepts together as the bottleneck layer, leading to the spurious cue inference problem and cannot generalized to unseen classes. To address these limitations, we propose the Attribute-formed Language Bottleneck Model (ALBM). ALBM organizes concepts in the attribute-formed class-specific space, where concepts are descriptions of specific attributes for specific classes. In this way, ALBM can avoid the spurious cue inference problem by classifying solely based on the essential concepts of each class. In addition, the cross-class unified attribute set also ensures that the concept spaces of different classes have strong correlations, as a result, the learned concept classifier can be easily generalized to unseen classes. Moreover, to further improve interpretability, we propose Visual Attribute Prompt Learning (VAPL) to extract visual features on fine-grained attributes. Furthermore, to avoid labor-intensive concept annotation, we propose the Description, Summary, and Supplement (DSS) strategy to automatically generate high-quality concept sets with a complete and precise attribute. Extensive experiments on 9 widely used few-shot benchmarks demonstrate the interpretability, transferability, and performance of our approach.

The text component can either be extracted explicitly with the use of external OCR models in OCR-based approaches, or alternatively, the vision model can be endowed with reading capabilities in OCR-free approaches. Typically, the queries to the model are input exclusively to the language component, necessitating the visual features to encompass the entire document. In this paper, we present VisFocus, an OCR-free method designed to better exploit the vision encoder's capacity by coupling it directly with the language prompt. To do so, we replace the down-sampling layers with layers that receive the input prompt and allow highlighting relevant parts of the document, while disregarding others. We pair the architecture enhancements with a novel pre-training task, using language masking on a snippet of the document text fed to the visual encoder in place of the prompt, to empower the model with focusing capabilities. Consequently, VisFocus learns to allocate its attention to text patches pertinent to the provided prompt. Our experiments demonstrate that this prompt-guided visual encoding approach significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, official code at https://github.com/amazon-science/visfocus</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/amazon-science/visfocus) |

While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.

Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably sized backbones while demonstrating favorable performance.

To automate this process, a scene generation model should be able to not only generate plausible scene layouts, but also take into consideration visual features and style preferences. Existing methods for this task exhibit very limited control over these attributes, only allowing text inputs in the form of simple object-level descriptions or pairwise spatial relationships. Our proposed method Decorum enables users to control the scene generation process with natural language by adopting language-based representations at each stage. This enables us to harness recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to model language-to-language mappings. In addition, we show that using a text-based representation allows us to select furniture for our scenes using a novel object retrieval method based on multimodal LLMs. Evaluations on the benchmark 3D-FRONT dataset show that our methods achieve improvements over existing work in text-conditioned scene synthesis and object retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by the shared principles between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine image details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing compressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of frequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in images, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the representation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized Features to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we further optimize the pipelines by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of our Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame compression and super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jayisaking.github.io/FIPER/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jayisaking.github.io/FIPER) |

Traditional CIL methods are mainly based on visual features, which limits their ability to handle complex scenarios. In contrast, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promising potential to promote CIL by integrating pretrained knowledge with textual features. However, previous methods make it difficult to overcome catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization capabilities of VLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose Feature Calibration enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) in this paper. Specifically, our FCPS employs a specific parameter adjustment mechanism to iteratively refine the proportion of original visual features participating in the final class determination, ensuring the model's foundational generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, parameter integration across different tasks achieves a balance between learning new class knowledge and retaining old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a unified approach to align these models across diverse tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering remains a challenge. Existing methods either require very big language models or very big datasets which is not efficient in utilizing existing models. This paper addresses this gap and devises a training strategy of auto-regressive vision-language models, to unify vision-language tasks like image-captioning and visual question answering. We propose four training stages for aligning the vision model with the language model, in other words, the language model is given an ability to process visual inputs. We also devise different attention masks for training transformer-based language models that improve the quality of visual features. Further, we introduce some findings, 1) the attention mask should not be applied on visual inputs, 2) the Language model converges faster on AI- generated data, 3) More work should be done in the alignment stage during the pre-training of the model, 4) the model can easily adapt to any downstream tasks like visual question answering on healthcare datasets like PathVQA. After training the model for one epoch for all the stages, it outperforms large models like VILA-13 billion models on common benchmarks like CIDEr scores on COCO and Flickr30k datasets and achieves very close scores to GIT-2 on the same dataset despite being a much smaller model trained on a much smaller dataset. All of the training is done using best practices available like multi- GPU parallel training, lower-precision training with 16-bit float numbers, faster attention (SDPA), and gradient accumulation, and completed the training within 12 hours.</p></details> |  | None |

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance.

The recently developed text-guided SR approaches leverage textual descriptions to enhance their detail restoration capabilities but frequently struggle with effectively performing alignment, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal semantic enhancement framework that integrates textual semantics with visual features, effectively mitigating semantic mismatches and detail losses in highly degraded low-resolution (LR) images. Our method enables realistic, high-quality SR to be performed at large upscaling factors, with a maximum scaling ratio of 16$\times$. The framework integrates both text and image inputs using the prompt predictor, the Text-Image Fusion Block (TIFBlock), and the Iterative Refinement Module, leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) features to guide a progressive enhancement process with fine-grained alignment. This synergy produces high-resolution outputs with sharp textures and strong semantic coherence, even at substantial scaling factors. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, by leveraging textual semantics, our method offers a degree of super-resolution editability, allowing for controlled enhancements while preserving semantic consistency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

Current models, such as CNN and Transformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but fail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., "doctor" vs. "nurse" in a hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g., differentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous driving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are employed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies that are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual understanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language, paving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready.

Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models, the evaluation metrics employed by these models, such as BLEU and Edit Distance, still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data, thereby causing unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end, we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric, ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing an image-level rather than a LaTeX-level metric score. Specifically, CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas, then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching, incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally, we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM, BLEU, and ExpRate metrics. Their results demonstrate that the CDM aligns more closely with human evaluation standards and provides a fairer comparison across different models by eliminating discrepancies caused by diverse formula representations.

However, existing SS-DFER methods mainly utilize generated semantic-level pseudo-labels for supervised learning, the unreliability of which compromises their performance and undermines the practical utility. In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER framework that simultaneously incorporates semantic, instance, and text-level information to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Specifically, for the unlabeled data, considering the comprehensive knowledge within the textual descriptions and instance representations, we respectively calculate the similarities between the facial vision features and the corresponding textual and instance features to obtain the probabilities at the text- and instance-level. Combining with the semantic-level probability, these three-level probabilities are elaborately aggregated to gain the final pseudo-labels. Furthermore, to enhance the utilization of one-hot labels for the labeled data, we also incorporate text embeddings excavated from textual descriptions to co-supervise model training, enabling facial visual features to exhibit semantic correlations in the text space. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art SS-DFER methods and even exceeds fully supervised baselines.

While substantial research has focused on either the visual or textual components of memes, little attention has been given to their interplay. This gap raises a key question: What methodology can effectively compare memes and the emotions they elicit? Our study employs a multimodal methodological approach, analyzing both the visual and textual elements of memes. Specifically, we perform a multimodal CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model for grouping similar memes based on text and visual content embeddings, enabling robust similarity assessments across modalities. Using the Reddit Meme Dataset and Memotion Dataset, we extract low-level visual features and high-level semantic features to identify similar meme pairs. To validate these automated similarity assessments, we conducted a user study with 50 participants, asking them to provide yes/no responses regarding meme similarity and their emotional reactions. The comparison of experimental results with human judgments showed a 67.23\% agreement, suggesting that the computational approach aligns well with human perception. Additionally, we implemented a text-based classifier using the DistilBERT model to categorize memes into one of six basic emotions. The results indicate that anger and joy are the dominant emotions in memes, with motivational memes eliciting stronger emotional responses. This research contributes to the study of multimodal memes, enhancing both language-based and visual approaches to analyzing and improving online visual communication and user experiences.

| **[InterLCM: Low-Quality Images as Intermediate States of Latent Consistency Models for Effective Blind Face Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02215v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion priors have been used for blind face restoration (BFR) by fine-tuning diffusion models (DMs) on restoration datasets to recover low-quality images. However, the naive application of DMs presents several key limitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g., ID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR model; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the effective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful restoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns consistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows more semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and color preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior semantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating low-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a balance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM also allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to improved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate structural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to extract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details, enhancing the fidelity of restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterLCM outperforms existing approaches in both synthetic and real-world datasets while also achieving faster inference speed.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR2025 | None |
| **[Feature-Based Dual Visual Feature Extraction Model for Compound Multimodal Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17453v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents our results for the eighth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition.Multimodal emotion recognition (ER) has important applications in affective computing and human-computer interaction. However, in the real world, compound emotion recognition faces greater issues of uncertainty and modal conflicts. For the Compound Expression (CE) Recognition Challenge,this paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition method that fuses the features of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Residual Network (ResNet). We conducted experiments on the C-EXPR-DB and MELD datasets. The results show that in scenarios with complex visual and audio cues (such as C-EXPR-DB), the model that fuses the features of ViT and ResNet exhibits superior performance.Our code are avalible on https://github.com/MyGitHub-ax/8th_ABAW</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MyGitHub-ax/8th_ABAW) |
| **[United we stand, Divided we fall: Handling Weak Complementary Relationships for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition in Valence-Arousal Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12261v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio and visual modalities are two predominant contact-free channels in videos, which are often expected to carry a complementary relationship with each other. However, they may not always complement each other, resulting in poor audio-visual feature representations. In this paper, we introduce Gated Recursive Joint Cross Attention (GRJCA) using a gating mechanism that can adaptively choose the most relevant features to effectively capture the synergic relationships across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we improve the performance of Recursive Joint Cross-Attention (RJCA) by introducing a gating mechanism to control the flow of information between the input features and the attended features of multiple iterations depending on the strength of their complementary relationship. For instance, if the modalities exhibit strong complementary relationships, the gating mechanism emphasizes cross-attended features, otherwise non-attended features. To further improve the performance of the system, we also explored a hierarchical gating approach by introducing a gating mechanism at every iteration, followed by high-level gating across the gated outputs of each iteration. The proposed approach improves the performance of RJCA model by adding more flexibility to deal with weak complementary relationships across audio and visual modalities. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Affwild2 dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. By effectively handling the weak complementary relationships across the audio and visual modalities, the proposed model achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.561 (0.623) and 0.620 (0.660) for valence and arousal respectively on the test set (validation set).</p></details> | <details><summary>Achie...</summary><p>Achieved 2nd place in valence arousal challenge Submission to CVPR2025 Workshop</p></details> | None |
