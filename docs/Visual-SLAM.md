| **[Spatia: Video Generation with Updatable Spatial Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15716v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing, providing a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhaojingjing713.github.io/Spatia/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zhaojingjing713.github.io/Spatia) |

| **[Dynamic Visual SLAM using a General 3D Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06868v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable incremental estimation of camera poses and 3D reconstruction is key to enable various applications including robotics, interactive visualization, and augmented reality. However, this task is particularly challenging in dynamic natural environments, where scene dynamics can severely deteriorate camera pose estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel monocular visual SLAM system that can robustly estimate camera poses in dynamic scenes. To this end, we leverage the complementary strengths of geometric patch-based online bundle adjustment and recent feed-forward reconstruction models. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward reconstruction model to precisely filter out dynamic regions, while also utilizing its depth prediction to enhance the robustness of the patch-based visual SLAM. By aligning depth prediction with estimated patches from bundle adjustment, we robustly handle the inherent scale ambiguities of the batch-wise application of the feed-forward reconstruction model.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[KM-ViPE: Online Tightly Coupled Vision-Language-Geometry Fusion for Open-Vocabulary Semantic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01889v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Integration of UWB Radar on Mobile Robots for Continuous Obstacle and Environment Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01018v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an infrastructure-free approach for obstacle detection and environmental mapping using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Access Journal and is currently undergoing review</p></details> | None |
| **[DiskChunGS: Large-Scale 3D Gaussian SLAM Through Chunk-Based Memory Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23030v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis with real-time rendering capabilities. However, integrating 3DGS with SLAM systems faces a fundamental scalability limitation: methods are constrained by GPU memory capacity, restricting reconstruction to small-scale environments. We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms. Our method uniquely completes all 11 KITTI sequences without memory failures while achieving superior visual quality, demonstrating that algorithmic innovation can overcome the memory constraints that have limited previous 3DGS SLAM methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters) |

The key idea is to leverage a sparse, yet compact, volumetric scene representation as our backend, enabling geometric reasoning with spatial compactness. Although trained solely for multi-view reconstruction, we demonstrate that AMB3R can be seamlessly extended to uncalibrated visual odometry (online) or large-scale structure from motion without the need for task-specific fine-tuning or test-time optimization. Compared to prior pointmap-based models, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose, depth, and metric-scale estimation, 3D reconstruction, and even surpasses optimization-based SLAM and SfM methods with dense reconstruction priors on common benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hengyiwang.github.io/projects/amber</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hengyiwang.github.io/projects) |
| **[SP-VINS: A Hybrid Stereo Visual Inertial Navigation System based on Implicit Environmental Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18756v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filter-based visual inertial navigation system (VINS) has attracted mobile-robot researchers for the good balance between accuracy and efficiency, but its limited mapping quality hampers long-term high-accuracy state estimation. To this end, we first propose a novel filter-based stereo VINS, differing from traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems based on 3D map, which performs efficient loop closure constraints with implicit environmental map composed of keyframes and 2D keypoints. Secondly, we proposed a hybrid residual filter framework that combines landmark reprojection and ray constraints to construct a unified Jacobian matrix for measurement updates. Finally, considering the degraded environment, we incorporated the camera-IMU extrinsic parameters into visual description to achieve online calibration. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed SP-VINS achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining long-term high-accuracy localization performance, and is superior to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stable Multi-Drone GNSS Tracking System for Marine Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18694v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gaze Beyond the Frame: Forecasting Egocentric 3D Visual Span](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18470v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> | None |
| **[Unobservable Subspace Evolution and Alignment for Consistent Visual-Inertial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17992v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inconsistency issue in the Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) is a long-standing and fundamental challenge. While existing studies primarily attribute the inconsistency to observability mismatch, these analyses are often based on simplified theoretical formulations that consider only prediction and SLAM correction. Such formulations fail to cover the non-standard estimation steps, such as MSCKF correction and delayed initialization, which are critical for practical VINS estimators. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how inconsistency dynamically emerges across estimation steps has hindered the development of precise and efficient solutions. As a result, current approaches often face a trade-off between estimator accuracy, consistency, and implementation complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel analysis framework termed Unobservable Subspace Evolution (USE), which systematically characterizes how the unobservable subspace evolves throughout the entire estimation pipeline by explicitly tracking changes in its evaluation points. This perspective sheds new light on how individual estimation steps contribute to inconsistency. Our analysis reveals that observability misalignment induced by certain steps is the antecedent of observability mismatch. Guided by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution paradigm, Unobservable Subspace Alignment (USA), which eliminates inconsistency by selectively intervening only in those estimation steps that induce misalignment. We design two USA methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based, both offering accurate and computationally lightweight solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[DynoSAM: Open-Source Smoothing and Mapping Framework for Dynamic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11893v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems focus solely on static scene structures, overlooking dynamic elements in the environment. Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems.

| **[CRISTAL: Real-time Camera Registration in Static LiDAR Scans using Neural Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16349v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce the PuzzlePole, a new type of fiducial markers derived from the recently proposed PuzzleBoard calibration pattern. The PuzzlePole is a cylindrical marker, enabling reliable recognition and pose estimation from 360° viewing direction. By leveraging the unique combinatorial structure of the PuzzleBoard pattern, PuzzlePoles provide a high accuracy in localization and orientation while being robust to occlusions. The design offers flexibility for deployment in diverse autonomous systems scenarios, ranging from robot navigation and SLAM to tangible interfaces.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iGaussian: Real-Time Camera Pose Estimation via Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14149v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

This paper presents a hierarchical quantization optimization framework, DPVO-QAT++ (DPVO-QAT++: Heterogeneous QAT and CUDA Kernel Fusion for High-Performance Deep Patch Visual Odometry). Through the synergistic integration of learnable scale parameterization, a heterogeneous precision design for the Visual Odometry (VO) front-end and back-end (front-end floating-point fake quantization with FP16/FP32; back-end full precision), and GPU-native kernel fusion for fake quantization (custom CUDA kernels), our framework significantly reduces memory footprint and increases processing speed while preserving the trajectory accuracy of the original model. On the TartanAir dataset, our framework achieves an average FPS increase of 52.1%, a 29.1% reduction in median latency, and a 64.9% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, while maintaining trajectory accuracy (ATE) comparable to the original DPVO model across 32 validation sequences. On the EuRoC dataset, it realizes an average FPS increase of 30.1%, a 23.1% reduction in median latency, and a 37.7% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, maintaining comparable trajectory accuracy (ATE) across 11 validation sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that DPVO-QAT++ effectively bridges the gap between high-precision deep VO and the efficiency requirements for practical deployment, offering a viable engineering paradigm for the application of this technology on real-world embedded platforms.

| **[ICD-Net: Inertial Covariance Displacement Network for Drone Visual-Inertial SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00037v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial SLAM systems often exhibit suboptimal performance due to multiple confounding factors including imperfect sensor calibration, noisy measurements, rapid motion dynamics, low illumination, and the inherent limitations of traditional inertial navigation integration methods. These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats, such as scene graphs, has not been widely addressed, resulting in complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces vS-Graphs, a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and floors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs achieves an average of 15.22% accuracy gain across all tested datasets compared to state-of-the-art VSLAM methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to that of precise LiDAR-based frameworks, using only visual features.

However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.</p></details> |  | None |

The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While visual-inertial SLAM has become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy.

| **[Multi-cam Multi-map Visual Inertial Localization: System, Validation and Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04287v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot control loops require causal pose estimates that depend only on past and present measurements. At each timestep, controllers compute commands using the current pose without waiting for future refinements. While traditional visual SLAM systems achieve high accuracy through retrospective loop closures, these corrections arrive after control decisions were already executed, violating causality. Visual-inertial odometry maintains causality but accumulates unbounded drift over time. To address the distinct requirements of robot control, we propose a multi-camera multi-map visual-inertial localization system providing real-time, causal pose estimation with bounded localization error through continuous map constraints. Since standard trajectory metrics evaluate post-processed trajectories, we analyze the error composition of map-based localization systems and propose a set of evaluation metrics suitable for measuring causal localization performance. To validate our system, we design a multi-camera IMU hardware setup and collect a challenging long-term campus dataset featuring diverse illumination and seasonal conditions.

In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power. This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization. We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots.

In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</p></details> | Dynamic SLAM | [Code Link](https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM) |

We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Visualization techniques, such as class activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks. Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes. However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>doubl...</summary><p>double-column 5 pages, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics. With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter, attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments, such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the Bicocca25b dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density, repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003 (correct matches).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 7 equations</p></details> | None |

While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF).

However, VPR systems face significant challenges when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular. On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal). The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures | None |

Existing methods face a major tradeoff: per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive, whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-RO.

However, construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation, leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges. Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned" architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose EgoExo, a geometry-driven solution integrated into a visual SLAM pipeline that synthesizes on-demand exocentric (third-person) views from egocentric camera feeds. Our proposed framework, EgoExo++, extends beyond 2D exocentric view synthesis (EgoExo) to augment a dense 2.5D ground surface estimation on-the-fly. It simultaneously renders the ROV model onto this reconstructed surface, enhancing semantic perception and depth comprehension. The computations involved are closed-form and rely solely on egocentric views and monocular SLAM estimates, which makes it portable across existing teleoperation engines and robust to varying waterbody characteristics. We validate the geometric accuracy of our approach through extensive experiments of 2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in challenging low-light conditions. Quantitative metrics confirm the reliability of the rendered Exo views, while a user study involving 15 operators demonstrates improved situational awareness, navigation safety, and task efficiency during teleoperation. Furthermore, we highlight the role of EgoExo++ augmented visuals in supporting shared autonomy, operator training, and embodied teleoperation.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R Code: https://github.com/fanegg/Human3R</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/fanegg/Human3R) |

Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities: visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against state-of-the-art alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark, while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the art accuracy in the diverse and large-scale sequences from the VBR dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) - Special Issue: Visual SLAM</p></details> | None |

We introduce a novel method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework, utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website: https://sites.google.com/view/con-nrsfm.</p></details> |  | None |

Many of the available visual SLAM methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, all while operating in near real-time.

While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches.

In this work, we present Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes, without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint. To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability.

Since the first foundational work in Semantic SLAM appeared more than two decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across various scientific communities. Despite its significance, the field lacks comprehensive surveys encompassing recent advances and persistent challenges. In response, this study provides a thorough examination of the state-of-the-art of Semantic SLAM techniques, with the aim of illuminating current trends and key obstacles. Beginning with an in-depth exploration of the evolution of visual SLAM, this study outlines its strengths and unique characteristics, while also critically assessing previous survey literature. Subsequently, a unified problem formulation and evaluation of the modular solution framework is proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM datasets. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this study serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking to navigate the complex landscape of Semantic SLAM.</p></details> |  | None |

It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on both desktop and resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

Traditional feature-based methods suffer from failures due to poor lighting, insufficient texture, and large motions. In contrast, recent learning-based dense SLAM methods exploit iterative dense bundle adjustment to address such failure cases, and achieve robust and accurate localization in a wide variety of real environments, without depending on domain-specific supervision. However, despite its potential, the methods still struggle with scenarios involving large motion and object dynamics. In this study, we diagnose key weaknesses in a popular learning-based dense SLAM model (DROID-SLAM) by analyzing major failure cases on outdoor benchmarks and exposing various shortcomings of its optimization process. We then propose the use of self-supervised priors leveraging a frozen large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator to initialize the dense bundle adjustment process, leading to robust visual odometry without the need to fine-tune the SLAM backbone. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements on KITTI odometry, as well as the challenging DDAD benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://toyotafrc.github.io/SGInit-Proj/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://toyotafrc.github.io/SGInit-Proj) |

However, most existing methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps, apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

A user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$ overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.</p></details> |  | None |

To deal with these issues, we propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance. Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning. This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion) |

This is partly due to the lack of controlled, ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges, such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes, using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance. Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks, including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of our system for two underwater vision tasks.

Addressing geometric inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled, confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM.</p></details> |  | None |

In such cases, dynamic near-field lighting introduces strong, view-dependent shading that significantly degrades SLAM performance. We introduce Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss (NFL-BA) which explicitly models near-field lighting as a part of Bundle Adjustment loss and enables better performance for scenes captured with dynamic lighting. NFL-BA can be integrated into neural rendering-based SLAM systems with implicit or explicit scene representations. Our evaluations mainly focus on endoscopy procedure where SLAM can enable autonomous navigation, guidance to unsurveyed regions, blindspot detections, and 3D visualizations, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and endoscopy experience for both physicians and patients. Replacing Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss of SLAM systems with NFL-BA leads to significant improvement in camera tracking, 37% for MonoGS and 14% for EndoGS, and leads to state-of-the-art camera tracking and mapping performance on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset. Further evaluation on indoor scenes captured with phone camera with flashlight turned on, also demonstrate significant improvement in SLAM performance due to NFL-BA.

The system allows human operators to directly interact with and visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts (e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for enhanced situational awareness.

Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters.

LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms. Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map. To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites, reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14% compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built scene, even under partially constructed conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> | None |

Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances. In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation efficiency.

While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, realising scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We present a novel LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by constraining the radiance field with the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction. We also provide an open-source implementation of PING at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PINGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, presented at RSS 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/PRBonn/PINGS) |

The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The sparse multi-maps are adequate for robust camera localization, however they are very poor for environment representation, they are noisy, with a high percentage of inaccurately reconstructed 3D points, including significant outliers, and more importantly with an unacceptable low density for clinical applications. We propose a method to remove outliers and densify the maps of the state of the art for sparse endoscopy multi-map CudaSIFT-SLAM. The NN LightDepth for up-to-scale depth dense predictions are aligned with the sparse CudaSIFT submaps by means of the robust to spurious LMedS. Our system mitigates the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation while filtering outliers, leading to reliable densified 3D maps. We provide experimental evidence of accurate densified maps 4.15 mm RMS accuracy at affordable computing time in the C3VD phantom colon dataset.

However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |

Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity, causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and multi-feature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to International Conference on Robotic Computing and Communication(IEEE IRC)</p></details> | None |

In feature-based SLAM, the quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2) insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies. To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii) depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient. Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.</p></details> | submitted | None |

To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians.

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability.

An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  | None |

While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual deblur SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs and enhance image deblurring. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.

First, our system directly operates on raw fisheye images, enabling us to fully exploit the wide Field-of-View (FoV) of fisheye cameras. Second, to overcome the low-texture challenge, we explore the tightly-coupled integration of multi-camera inputs and complementary inertial measurements via a unified factor graph and jointly optimize the poses and dense depth maps. Third, for global consistency, the wide FoV of the fisheye camera allows the system to find more potential loop closures, and powered by the broad convergence basin of RFT, our system can perform very wide baseline loop closing with little overlap. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-pose-graph BA method to avoid the expensive full global BA. By combining relative pose factors with loop closure factors, the global states can be adjusted efficiently with modest memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations on TUM-VI, Hilti-Oxford and Newer College datasets show the superior performance of the proposed system over prior works.

Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction.

In this paper we present an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) system which purely relies on cost-effective and light-weight passive visual and inertial sensors to perform large-scale autonomous navigation in outdoor,unstructured and cluttered environments. We leverage visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) for accurate MAV state estimates and couple it with a volumetric occupancy submapping system to achieve a scalable mapping framework which can be directly used for path planning. To ensure the safety of the MAV during navigation, we also propose a novel reference trajectory anchoring scheme that deforms the reference trajectory the MAV is tracking upon state updates from the VI-SLAM system in a consistent way, even upon large state updates due to loop-closures. We thoroughly validate our system in both real and simulated forest environments and at peak velocities up to 3 m/s while not encountering a single collision or system failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system which achieves this level of performance in such an unstructured environment using low-cost passive visual sensors and fully on-board computation, including VI-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |

While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple virtual reality headsets.

However, traditional SLAM methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of dynamic interference.

While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while maintaining the rendering quality.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP).

While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching.

However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</p></details> |  | None |

A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.</p></details> |  | None |

Although multi-sensor fusion approaches integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental conditions.

Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational overhead.

The proposed method performs robust and accurate pose estimation within a continuous-time trajectory optimization framework, while incrementally reconstructing a 3D Gaussian map using camera and LiDAR data, all in real time. The resulting map enables high-quality, real-time novel view rendering of both RGB images and depth maps. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis.

Underwater caves are crucial for fresh water resource management, underwater archaeology, and hydrogeology. Mapping the cave's outline and dimensions, as well as creating photorealistic 3D maps, is critical for enabling a better understanding of this underwater domain. In this paper, we present the mapping of an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at Ginnie Springs, FL. We utilized a set of inexpensive action cameras in conjunction with a dive computer to estimate the trajectories of the cameras together with a sparse point cloud. The resulting reconstructions are utilized to produce a one-dimensional retract of the cave passages in the form of the average trajectory together with the boundaries (top, bottom, left, and right). The use of the dive computer enables the observability of the z-dimension in addition to the roll and pitch in a visual/inertial framework (SVIn2). In addition, the keyframes generated by SVIn2 together with the estimated camera poses for select areas are used as input to a global optimization (bundle adjustment) framework -- COLMAP -- in order to produce a dense reconstruction of those areas. The same cave segment is manually surveyed using the MNemo V2 instrument, providing an additional set of measurements validating the proposed approach. It is worth noting that with the use of action cameras, the primary components of a cave map can be constructed. Furthermore, with the utilization of a global optimization framework guided by the results of VI-SLAM package SVIn2, photorealistic dense 3D representations of selected areas can be reconstructed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> | None |

However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at MICCAI2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate an average frame rate of 36 FPS on Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets, achieving competitive accuracy in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  | None |

In unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), most research emphasizes visual SLAM, sensor fusion, and path planning. However, applying UAVs to search and rescue missions in disaster zones remains underexplored, especially for autonomous navigation. This report develops methods for real-time and secure UAV maneuvering in complex 3D environments, crucial during forest fires. Building upon past research, it focuses on designing navigation algorithms for unfamiliar and hazardous environments, aiming to improve rescue efficiency and safety through UAV-based early warning and rapid response. The work unfolds in phases. First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is explored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic settings. This sets the stage for advanced features such as adaptive obstacle handling and decision-making enhancements. Next, a novel 3D reactive navigation strategy is introduced for collision-free movement in forest fire simulations, addressing the unique challenges of UAV operations in such scenarios. Finally, the report proposes a unified control approach that integrates UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for coordinated rescue missions in forest environments. Each phase presents challenges, proposes control models, and validates them with mathematical and simulation-based evidence.

However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.</p></details> | IROS 2025 | None |

The proposed benchmark provides drastic appearance variations caused by seasonal changes and diverse weather and illumination conditions. While significant progress has been made in advancing visual SLAM on small-scale datasets with similar conditions, there is still a lack of unified benchmarks representative of real-world scenarios for autonomous driving. We introduce a new unified benchmark for jointly evaluating visual odometry, global place recognition, and map-based visual localization performance which is crucial to successfully enable autonomous driving in any condition. The data has been collected for more than one year, resulting in more than 300 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from a multi-level parking garage to urban (including tunnels) to countryside and highway. We provide globally consistent reference poses with up to centimeter-level accuracy obtained from the fusion of direct stereo-inertial odometry with RTK GNSS. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art visual odometry and visual localization baseline approaches on the benchmark and analyze their properties.

Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication.

However, limited research has explored the integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally, the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active SLAM systems in complex environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures | None |

The widely adopted ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and (iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for learning-based loop closure. On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010 deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3 accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.

However, these methods incur significant computational overhead as the camera tracking needs to wait for the deep neural network to generate mask at each frame, and they typically require GPUs for real-time operation, which restricts their practicality in real-world robotic applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs exclusively on a CPU. Our approach incorporates a mask propagation mechanism that decouples camera tracking and deep learning-based masking for each frame. We also introduce a hybrid tracking strategy that integrates ORB features with optical flow methods, enhancing both robustness and efficiency by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared to previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 60 FPS on a laptop CPU. These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing deep learning for dynamic SLAM without GPU support.

Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over 7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Vision-based systems have been integral to these advancements, capturing rich color and texture at low cost while enabling semantic scene understanding. However, underwater conditions -- such as light attenuation, backscatter, and low contrast -- often degrade image quality to the point where traditional vision-based SLAM pipelines fail. Moreover, these pipelines typically rely on monocular or stereo inputs, limiting their scalability to the multi-camera configurations common on many vehicles. To address these issues, we propose to leverage multi-modal sensing that fuses data from multiple sensors-including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and acoustic devices-to enhance situational awareness and enable robust, real-time SLAM. We explore both geometric and learning-based techniques along with semantic analysis, and conduct experiments on the data collected from a work-class ROV during several field deployments in the Trondheim Fjord. Through our experimental results, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time reliable state estimation and high-quality 3D reconstructions in visually challenging underwater conditions. We also discuss system constraints and identify open research questions, such as sensor calibration, limitations with learning-based methods, that merit further exploration to advance large-scale underwater operations.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research. By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies, this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape and highlights key avenues for further innovation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., "go to the couch").

Navigation by machine olfaction (artificial smell) is a very difficult task to both simulate and solve. With this work, we define olfactory inertial odometry (OIO), a framework for using inertial kinematics, and fast-sampling olfaction sensors to enable navigation by scent analogous to visual inertial odometry (VIO). We establish how principles from SLAM and VIO can be extrapolated to olfaction to enable real-world robotic tasks. We demonstrate OIO with three different odour localization algorithms on a real 5-DoF robot arm over an odour-tracking scenario that resembles real applications in agriculture and food quality control. Our results indicate success in establishing a baseline framework for OIO from which other research in olfactory navigation can build, and we note performance enhancements that can be made to address more complex tasks in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously.

However, their sequential optimization framework and sensitivity to dynamic objects limit real-time performance and robustness in real-world scenarios. We present UP-SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system for dynamic environments that decouples tracking and mapping through a parallelized framework. A probabilistic octree is employed to manage Gaussian primitives adaptively, enabling efficient initialization and pruning without hand-crafted thresholds. To robustly filter dynamic regions during tracking, we propose a training-free uncertainty estimator that fuses multi-modal residuals to estimate per-pixel motion uncertainty, achieving open-set dynamic object handling without reliance on semantic labels. Furthermore, a temporal encoder is designed to enhance rendering quality. Concurrently, low-dimensional features are efficiently transformed via a shallow multilayer perceptron to construct DINO features, which are then employed to enrich the Gaussian field and improve the robustness of uncertainty prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets suggest that UP-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy (by 59.8%) and rendering quality (by 4.57 dB PSNR), while maintaining real-time performance and producing reusable, artifact-free static maps in dynamic environments.The project: https://aczheng-cai.github.io/up_slam.github.io/</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://aczheng-cai.github.io/up_slam.github.io) |

However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).

To this end, an innovative strategy-based hybrid framework HS-SLAM is proposed to integrate the advantages of direct and feature-based methods for fast computation without decreasing the performance. It first estimates the relative positions of consecutive frames using IMU pose estimation within the tracking thread. Then, it refines these estimates through a multi-layer direct method, which progressively corrects the relative pose from coarse to fine, ultimately achieving accurate corner-based feature matching. This approach serves as an alternative to the conventional constant-velocity tracking model. By selectively bypassing descriptor extraction for non-critical frames, HS-SLAM significantly improves the tracking speed. Experimental evaluations on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate that HS-SLAM achieves higher localization accuracies than ORB-SLAM3 while improving the average tracking efficiency by 15%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework.

The hand-crafted descriptors in classical semantic-aided registration, or the ground-truth annotation reliance in learning-based scene graph registration, impede their application in practical real-world environments. To address the challenges, we design a scene graph network to encode multiple modalities of semantic nodes: open-set semantic feature, local topology with spatial awareness, and shape feature. These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features. The matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation according to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and hierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and fewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new data generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping module to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from previous works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate data. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark. It significantly outperforms the hand-crafted baseline in terms of registration success rate. Compared to visual loop closure networks, our method achieves a slightly higher registration recall while requiring only 52 KB of communication bandwidth for each query frame.

A Comparative Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12384v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage. This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption. Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09915v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM. However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches.

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 system with the COVINS on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity real-time 3D maps. To operate Beyond the Visible (BtV) and overcome the limitations of standard visual sensors, we automated a standalone 4D mmWave radar module that functions independently without sensor fusion with SLAM. The BtV system enables the detection and mapping of occluded metallic objects in cluttered environments, enhancing situational awareness in inspection scenarios. Experimental validation in Section~\ref{sec:IV} demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE, ICARM</p></details> | None |

Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization.

Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.

Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IAVVC 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature.

We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions.

Recent advancements in underwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered significant attention in marine robotics research.

In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms.

However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix the overview figure</p></details> | None |

However, current methods fail to relocalize when faced with significantly different viewpoints. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map Alignment Anywhere), a global localization method capable of localizing in challenging and diverse environments by creating and aligning maps of open-set and view-invariant objects. ROMAN formulates and solves a registration problem between object submaps using a unified graph-theoretic global data association approach with a novel incorporation of a gravity direction prior and object shape and semantic similarity. This work's open-set object mapping and information-rich object association algorithm enables global localization, even in instances when maps are created from robots traveling in opposite directions. Through a set of challenging global localization experiments in indoor, urban, and unstructured/forested environments, we demonstrate that ROMAN achieves higher relative pose estimation accuracy than other image-based pose estimation methods or segment-based registration methods. Additionally, we evaluate ROMAN as a loop closure module in large-scale multi-robot SLAM and show a 35% improvement in trajectory estimation error compared to standard SLAM systems using visual features for loop closures.

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer 14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2 offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility. Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational and communication constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SmallGS: Gaussian Splatting-based Camera Pose Estimation for Small-Baseline Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17810v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion.

| **[An Online Adaptation Method for Robust Depth Estimation and Visual Odometry in the Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11698v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning-based robotic navigation systems have gained extensive research attention and made significant progress. However, the diversity of open-world scenarios poses a major challenge for the generalization of such systems to practical scenarios. Specifically, learned systems for scene measurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios deviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose estimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual odometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online manner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework for monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation module. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with lightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then, we construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation module based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual semantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification module and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage camera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks for the online adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on urban, in-house datasets and a robot platform.

However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM) |

To overcome the localization risks caused by dynamic landmarks in most VI-SLAM systems, a robust visual-inertial motion prior SLAM system, named IDY-VINS, is proposed in this paper which effectively handles dynamic landmarks using inertial motion prior for dynamic environments to varying degrees. Specifically, potential dynamic landmarks are preprocessed during the feature tracking phase by the probabilistic model of landmarks' minimum projection errors which are obtained from inertial motion prior and epipolar constraint. Subsequently, a robust and self-adaptive bundle adjustment residual is proposed considering the minimum projection error prior for dynamic candidate landmarks. This residual is integrated into a sliding window based nonlinear optimization process to estimate camera poses, IMU states and landmark positions while minimizing the impact of dynamic candidate landmarks that deviate from the motion prior. Finally, a clean point cloud map without `ghosting effect' is obtained that contains only static landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and time cost by robustly mitigating the influence of dynamic landmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a core task in computer vision that enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. Deep learning methods typically estimate relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale often leads to geometric inconsistencies. This limitation severely impacts applications such as visual SLAM, detailed 3D modeling, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses this issue by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency and supporting direct deployment without scale calibration. This paper presents a structured survey of depth estimation methods, tracing the evolution from traditional geometry-based approaches to modern deep learning models. Recent progress in MMDE is analyzed, with a focus on two key challenges: poor generalization and blurred object boundaries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored various strategies, including self-supervised learning with unlabeled data, patch-based training, architectural enhancements, and generative model integration. Each method is discussed in terms of technical contribution, performance improvement, and remaining limitations. The survey consolidates recent findings, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future directions for MMDE. By highlighting key advancements and open problems, this paper aims to support the continued development and real-world adoption of metric depth estimation in computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |

This work focuses on monocular RGB VO where the input is a monocular RGB video without IMU or 3D sensors. Existing approaches lack robustness under this challenging scenario and fail to generalize to unseen data (especially outdoors); they also cannot recover metric-scale poses. We propose Robust Metric Visual Odometry (RoMeO), a novel method that resolves these issues leveraging priors from pre-trained depth models. RoMeO incorporates both monocular metric depth and multi-view stereo (MVS) models to recover metric-scale, simplify correspondence search, provide better initialization and regularize optimization. Effective strategies are proposed to inject noise during training and adaptively filter noisy depth priors, which ensure the robustness of RoMeO on in-the-wild data. As shown in Fig.1, RoMeO advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin across 6 diverse datasets covering both indoor and outdoor scenes. Compared to the current SOTA DPVO, RoMeO reduces the relative (align the trajectory scale with GT) and absolute trajectory errors both by >50%. The performance gain also transfers to the full SLAM pipeline (with global BA & loop closure). Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

| **[SuperEvent: Cross-Modal Learning of Event-based Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00139v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based keypoint detection and matching holds significant potential, enabling the integration of event sensors into highly optimized Visual SLAM systems developed for frame cameras over decades of research. Unfortunately, existing approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints and the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited feature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict stable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event datasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based keypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized gray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint pseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance and camera motion. Combined with our novel, information-rich event representation, we enable SuperEvent to effectively learn robust keypoint detection and description in event streams. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and descriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras, surpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation. These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGBD cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGBD configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, semi-structured environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow sensing Field-of-View (FoV), resulting in degenerated accuracy and limited robustness in textureless environments. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy with much wider FoV. However, the usual arbitrary placement and orientation of multiple cameras make the pose scale estimation and system updating challenging. To address these problems, we propose a robust visual odometry system for rigidly-bundled arbitrarily-arranged multi-cameras, namely MCVO, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams to GPU. Then we initialize the odometry system with the metric-scale poses under the rigid constraints between moving cameras. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate its robustness over arbitrarily arranged cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose accuracy with better generalization ability.

We extend ORB-SLAM3's optimization pipeline to jointly process ToA data from 5G base stations alongside visual and inertial measurements while estimating system biases. This integration transforms the inherently local SLAM estimates into globally referenced trajectories and effectively resolves scale ambiguity in monocular configurations. Our method is evaluated using both Aerolab indoor datasets with RGB-D cameras and the EuRoC MAV benchmark, complemented by simulated 5G ToA measurements at 28 GHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa. Extensive experiments across multiple SLAM configurations demonstrate that ToA integration enables consistent global positioning across all modes while maintaining local accuracy. For monocular configurations, ToA integration successfully resolves scale ambiguity and improves consistency. We further investigate scenarios with unknown base station positions and demonstrate that ToA measurements can effectively serve as an alternative to loop closure for drift correction. We also analyze how different geometric arrangements of base stations impact SLAM performance. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods, including UWB-VO, confirms our approach's robustness even with lower measurement frequencies and sequential base station operation. The results validate that 5G ToA integration provides substantial benefits for global SLAM applications, particularly in challenging indoor environments where accurate positioning is critical.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While state-of-the art methods that relies on feature matching have proven to be accurate for visual localization, its requirements for storage and compute are burdens. Scene coordinate regression (SCR) is an alternative approach that remove the barrier for storage by learning to map 2D pixels to 3D scene coordinates. Most popular SCR use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract 2D descriptor, which we would argue that it miss the spatial relationship between pixels. Inspired by the success of vision transformer architecture, we present a new SCR architecture, called A-ScoRe, an Attention-based model which leverage attention on descriptor map level to produce meaningful and high-semantic 2D descriptors. Since the operation is performed on descriptor map, our model can work with multiple data modality whether it is a dense or sparse from depth-map, SLAM to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This versatility allows A-SCoRe to operate in different kind of environments, conditions and achieve the level of flexibility that is important for mobile robots. Results show our methods achieve comparable performance with State-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark while being light-weighted and much more flexible.

Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings.

Specifically, our method is rigorously uncertainty-aware: first, we use depth and uncertainty predictions from a deep network not only from the robot's stereo rig, but we further probabilistically fuse motion stereo that provides depth information across a range of baselines, therefore drastically increasing mapping accuracy. Next, predicted and fused depth uncertainty propagates not only into occupancy probabilities but also into alignment factors between generated dense submaps that enter the probabilistic nonlinear least squares estimator. This submap representation offers globally consistent geometry at scale. Our method is thoroughly evaluated in two benchmark datasets, resulting in localization and mapping accuracy that exceeds the state of the art, while simultaneously offering volumetric occupancy directly usable for downstream robotic planning and control in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, accepted in ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

However, students with visual impairments (VI) encounter significant challenges in programming and robotics, particularly in tracking robot movements and developing spatial awareness. This paper presents a framework that leverages pre-constructed robots and algorithms, such as maze-solving techniques, within an accessible learning environment. The proposed system employs Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to process global camera-captured maze layouts, converting visual data into textual descriptions that generate spatial audio prompts in an Audio Virtual Reality (AVR) system. Students issue verbal commands, which are refined through CLIP, while robot-mounted stereo cameras provide real-time data processed via Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for continuous feedback. By integrating these technologies, the framework empowers VI students to develop coding skills and engage in complex problem-solving tasks. Beyond maze-solving applications, this approach demonstrates the broader potential of computer vision in special education, contributing to improved accessibility and learning experiences in STEAM disciplines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures | None |

Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera.

Owing to their original use-case, such systems often only contain a single camera facing into either direction and very limited overlap between fields of view. Our novelty consist of three optimization modules targeting at practical online calibration of exterior orientations from simple two-view geometry, reliable front-end initialization of relative displacements, and accurate back-end optimization using a continuous-time trajectory model. The commonality between the proposed modules is given by the fact that all three of them exploit motion priors that are related to the inherent non-holonomic characteristics of passenger vehicle motion. In contrast to prior related art, the proposed modules furthermore excel in terms of bypassing partial unobservabilities in the transformation variables that commonly occur for Ackermann-motion. As a further contribution, the modules are built into a novel surround-view camera SLAM system that specifically targets deployment on Ackermann vehicles operating in urban environments. All modules are studied in the context of in-depth ablation studies, and the practical validity of the entire framework is supported by a successful application to challenging, large-scale publicly available online datasets. Note that upon acceptance, the entire framework is scheduled for open-source release as part of an extension of the OpenGV library.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping: (r)evolution from geometry to deep learning-based pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02955v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep learning, there is a fundamental change in visual SLAM algorithms toward developing different modules trained as end-to-end pipelines. However, regardless of the implementation domain, visual SLAM's performance is subject to diverse environmental challenges, such as dynamic elements in outdoor environments, harsh imaging conditions in underwater environments, or blurriness in high-speed setups. These environmental challenges need to be identified to study the real-world viability of SLAM implementations. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this paper surveys the current state of visual SLAM algorithms according to the two main frameworks: geometry-based and learning-based SLAM. First, we introduce a general formulation of the SLAM pipeline that includes most of the implementations in the literature. Second, those implementations are classified and surveyed for geometry and learning-based SLAM. After that, environment-specific challenges are formulated to enable experimental evaluation of the resilience of different visual SLAM classes to varying imaging conditions. We address two significant issues in surveying visual SLAM, providing (1) a consistent classification of visual SLAM pipelines and (2) a robust evaluation of their performance under different deployment conditions. Finally, we give our take on future opportunities for visual SLAM implementations.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, for line matching process, we propose a novel geometric line optical flow algorithm that efficiently tracks line features with varying lengths, whitch is do not require detections and descriptors in every frame. To address the instability of Manhattan estimation from line features, we propose a tracking-by-detection module that consistently tracks and optimizes Manhattan framse in consecutive images. By aligning the Manhattan World with the VIO world frame, the tracking could restart using the latest pose from back-end, simplifying the coordinate transformations within the system. Furthermore, we implement a mechanism to validate Manhattan frames and a novel global structural constraints back-end optimization.

However, traditional data collection systems for dexterous manipulation face challenges, including a lack of balance between acquisition efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce Exo-ViHa, an innovative 3D-printed exoskeleton system that enables users to collect data from a first-person perspective while providing real-time haptic feedback. This system combines a 3D-printed modular structure with a slam camera, a motion capture glove, and a wrist-mounted camera. Various dexterous hands can be installed at the end, enabling it to simultaneously collect the posture of the end effector, hand movements, and visual data. By leveraging the first-person perspective and direct interaction, the exoskeleton enhances the task realism and haptic feedback, improving the consistency between demonstrations and actual robot deployments. In addition, it has cross-platform compatibility with various robotic arms and dexterous hands. Experiments show that the system can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of data collection for dexterous manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Although numerous constraints have been proposed for dual quadric reconstruction, we found that many of them are imprecise and provide minimal improvements to localization.After scrutinizing the existing constraints, we introduce a concise yet more precise convex hull-based algebraic constraint for object landmarks, which is applied to object reconstruction, frontend pose estimation, and backend bundle adjustment.This constraint is designed to fully leverage precise semantic segmentation, effectively mitigating mismatches between complex-shaped object contours and dual quadrics.Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach is applicable to both monocular and RGB-D SLAM and achieves improved object mapping and localization than existing quadric SLAM methods.

While incorporating semantic scene knowledge aids in building richer maps with contextual associations among mapped objects, representing them in structured formats like scene graphs has not been widely addressed, encountering complex map comprehension and limited scalability. This paper introduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation. The framework infers structural elements (i.e., rooms and corridors) from detected building components (i.e., walls and ground surfaces) and incorporates them into optimizable 3D scene graphs. This solution enhances the reconstructed map's semantic richness, comprehensibility, and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs outperforms state-of-the-art VSLAM methods, reducing trajectory error by an average of 3.38% and up to 9.58% on real-world data. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves environment-driven semantic entity detection accuracy comparable to precise LiDAR-based frameworks using only visual features.

Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Action-Consistent Decentralized Belief Space Planning with Inconsistent Beliefs and Limited Data Sharing: Framework and Simplification Algorithms with Formal Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05962v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot systems, ensuring safe and reliable decision making under uncertain conditions demands robust multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) algorithms. While planning with multiple robots, each robot maintains a belief over the state of the environment and reasons how the belief would evolve in the future for different possible actions. However, existing MR-BSP works have a common assumption that the beliefs of different robots are same at planning time. Such an assumption is often unrealistic as it requires prohibitively extensive and frequent data sharing capabilities. In practice, robots may have limited communication capabilities, and consequently beliefs of the robots can be different. Crucially, when the robots have inconsistent beliefs, the existing approaches could result in lack of coordination between the robots and may lead to unsafe decisions. In this paper, we present decentralized MR-BSP algorithms, with performance guarantees, for tackling this crucial gap. Our algorithms leverage the notion of action preferences. The base algorithm VerifyAC guarantees a consistent joint action selection by the cooperative robots via a three-step verification. When the verification succeeds, VerifyAC finds a consistent joint action without triggering a communication; otherwise it triggers a communication. We design an extended algorithm R-VerifyAC for further reducing the number of communications, by relaxing the criteria of action consistency. Another extension R-VerifyAC-simp builds on verifying a partial set of observations and improves the computation time significantly. The theoretical performance guarantees are corroborated with simulation results in discrete setting. Furthermore, we formulate our approaches for continuous and high-dimensional state and observation spaces, and provide experimental results for active multi-robot visual SLAM with real robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The n...</summary><p>The new version has been extended from the existing arxiv version of the paper in the following way: - The old (base) algorithm VerifyAC has been retained in the new version. - Added two new algorithms R-VerifyAC and R-VerifyAC-simp along with their performance guarantees. - A new formulation in continuous spaces have been added. - Experimental results for the new approaches have been added</p></details> | None |

Achieving real-time SLAM on mobile robotic systems with limited computational resources is challenging because the complexity of SLAM algorithms increases over time. This restriction can be lifted by offloading computations to edge servers, forming the emerging paradigm of edge-assisted SLAM. Nevertheless, the exogenous and stochastic input processes affect the dynamics of the edge-assisted SLAM system. Moreover, the requirements of clients on SLAM metrics change over time, exerting implicit and time-varying effects on the system. In this paper, we aim to push the limit beyond existing edge-assist SLAM by proposing a new architecture that can handle the input-driven processes and also satisfy clients' implicit and time-varying requirements. The key innovations of our work involve a regional feature prediction method for importance-aware local data processing, a configuration adaptation policy that integrates data compression/decompression and task offloading, and an input-dependent learning framework for task scheduling with constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments prove that our architecture improves pose estimation accuracy and saves up to 47% of communication costs compared with a popular edge-assisted SLAM system, as well as effectively satisfies the clients' requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present a pipeline for the precise tool positioning of heavy-duty, long-reach (HDLR) manipulators using advanced machine vision. A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration to estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI). Based on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with motion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool positioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and control methods prevalent in the industry. The proposed methodology comprises orientation and position alignment based on the visually estimated OOI poses, whereas camera-to-robot calibration is conducted based on motion utilizing visual SLAM. The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from rigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via image-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation, only synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world setting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results demonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2 mm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to increase the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR manipulators.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline.
